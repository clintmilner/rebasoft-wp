<h2><span class="purple">Installation of License key</span></h2>
  <p>When accessing the MAC Auditor web interface for  the first time, it runs in trial mode &ndash; this means it will operate for a period  of 7 days unless a license key is applied to the system. License administration  is accessed from the Admin dropdown in the top frame, by clicking the arrow:</p>

<p>To add a license, simply cut and paste the license string into the &ldquo;New  License&rdquo; box and click &ldquo;load license&rdquo;. The license will validate and  confirmation of the system license will be displayed. If the license level is  exceeded, MAC Auditor will not collect information from the additional  interfaces until a new key is obtained from a MAC Auditor reseller.</p>
