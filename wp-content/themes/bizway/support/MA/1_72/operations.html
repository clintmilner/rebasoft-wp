<h2><a name="start"></a><span class="purple">Using MAC Auditor</span></h2>
<p>Once MAC Auditor is set-up and collecting information, it can be reported upon.
  There are two main methods of viewing reports and drilling further into the information
  collected:</p>
  <ul><li><a href="help.php?version=1.72&operations">Reports </a></li>
      <li><a href="#ops">Operations</a></li>
      <li><a href="help.php?version=1.72&searching">Searching</a></li>
      </ul>
<p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="lnor"></div>
<h2><a name="ops"></a><span class="purple">Operations</span></h2>
<p>In
  addition to reporting, MAC Auditor provides detailed forensics to allow users
  to logically drill down from Sites to devices to VLANs, interfaces or MACs. Users
  can relate usernames to IP addresses, so from a site, quickly locate a user and
  how they are connected to the network. </p>
<p>Starting
  from the view and month selector, navigation is simply an exercise in clicking
  hyperlinks. Selecting a Site in the Sites frame will give a Site overview
  report in the information frame, and list the member devices in the display
  frame. </p>
               <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image042.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Selecting
  a device will show a device overview interface statistic and lists of the
  interfaces and VLANs on the device: </p>
                 <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image043.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Device
  attributes provides device level information; showing the hostname, IP
  address/DNS name, OiD type and a description. All information in the device
  attributes area is searchable. </p>
                 <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image044.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below
  the device attributes, is a summary of Interfaces, VLAN and MAC&rsquo;s for the
  device: </p>
                   <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image045.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The
  Interface section provides a quick view of interfaces, real-time status, recent
  device status, type, MAC and IP related information for each interface. Hyperlinks
  allow drilldown to VLAN, MAC, and IP for further detailed information. </p>
<p>Clicking
  the current status link causes a chart to pop-up with a history of interface
  status over the last month. Each graph shows a 7 day view: </p>
                   <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image045.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any field underlined can be selected, so
  from the device level, users can drill to Interface and ultimately MAC, IP and
  User forensics.</a></p>
<p>The device view can also provide information
  on interface status. If you need to see the free ports by Site or device, clicking
  down interfaces will show those interfaces down and how they have been down in the
  current month:</p>

<div id="lnor"></div>
<h3>IP
  Forensics</h3>
<p>From any screen it is possible to drill into
  IP forensics, where details on DNS, UserID, ARP and interfaces are shown for
  the IP address</p>
                   <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image048.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b>Note: </b><br />
      DNS
        resolution is performed so that if DNS entries for the IP address in
        question exists, it is resolved &ndash; but you cannot search using DNS as DNS is
        not currently stored in the database.</td>
  </tr>
</table><p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="lnor"></div>

<h3>VLAN overview</h3>
<p>VLAN overview shows VLAN and MAC count for the VLAN.</p>
                 <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image049.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b>Note: </b><br />
          Where the VLAN
            is &ldquo;local&rdquo; there is no VLAN configured</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
                 <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image050.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>
                 <p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="lnor"></div>

<h3>MAC   forensics</h3>
<p>MAC forensics allows users to review the IP and
  connection history of a MAC address:</p>                 <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image051.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IP details show the history of IP address
  assignment to the MAC address.</p>
<p>Connections show the interfaces (and device)
  that the MAC address has been seen on (The MAC Count shows the total number
  of unique MAC&rsquo;s on the interface). </p>
<p>The Connection history shows the connections over time.</p>
<p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="lnor"></div><h3>User
  forensics</h3>
<p>User forensics can be used to find the IP
  and hence the MAC history of a UserID. This will be non-zero if  User
  Lookup administration  has been correctly
  configured, and MAC Auditor has had sufficient time to start collecting user
  data from LDAP or log sources:</p>
