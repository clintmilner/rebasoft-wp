<h2><a name="start"></a><span class="purple">Using MAC Auditor</span></h2>
<p>Once MAC Auditor is set-up and collecting information, it can be reported upon.
  There are two main methods of viewing reports and drilling further into the information
  collected:</p>
  <ul><li><a href="#reports">Reports </a></li>
      <li><a href="help.php?version=1.72&operations">Operations</a></li>
      <li><a href="help.php?version=1.72&searching">Searching</a></li>
      </ul>
<p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="lnor"></div>

<h3><a name="reports">Reports</a></h3>
<p>The Reports view is designed so that information at the
  Network, Site and device level can be understood and view graphically. To run reporing, users
  must first select the month of interest (default is the current month):</p>        
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image036.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center>

<p>Once the month has been selected, the Network, Site or
  device overview report must be run:</p>
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image037.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center>
 <p> Reports have been designed to show data in a consistent manner; with
  summary data, interface statistics, and scrolling down,<img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image038.jpg" border="0" width="250" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"/>
    users can graphically view the distribution of MAC addresses across top
    populated devices and a count of MAC addresses by day over the current month:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" >   
   <tr>   
    <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b>Note: </b><br />
      Total MAC Address figures include duplicates &amp; are
        designed to show a &ldquo;saturation level&rdquo; over time.</td>
  </tr>
</table><center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image039.jpg" border="0" width="350" /></center>


<p>There are a number of
  links from the Interface level summary, and a useful report can be the list of
  &ldquo;Down interfaces&rdquo;:</p>
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image040.jpg" border="0" width="350" /></center>
<p>The &ldquo;Down
  Interfaces&rdquo; report can be a useful guide to interfaces that have been down or
  unused over a period of time, potentially making them candidates as &ldquo;free
  ports&rdquo; available for use.</p>
    <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image041.jpg" border="0" width="350" /></center>

<p>Clicking the
  device, interface or other link will swap the user into the <a href="help.php?version=1.72&operations">operations view</a> of
  the item in question.</p>
