<h2><a name="start"></a><span class="purple">Using MAC Auditor</span></h2>
<p>Once MAC Auditor is set-up and collecting information, it can be reported upon.
  There are two main methods of viewing reports and drilling further into the information
  collected:</p>
  <ul><li><a href"#reports">Reports </a></li>
<li><a href"#ops">Operations </li></a></ul>
<p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="lnor"></div>

<h3><a name="reports">Reports</a></h3>
<p>The Reports view is designed so that information at the
  Network, Site and device level can be understood and view graphically. To run reporing, users
  must first select the month of interest (default is the current month):</p>        
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image036.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center>

<p>Once the month has been selected, the Network, Site or
  device overview report must be run:</p>
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image037.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center>
 <p> Reports have been designed to show data in a consistent manner; with
  summary data, interface statistics, and scrolling down,<img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image038.jpg" border="0" width="250" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left"/>
    users can graphically view the distribution of MAC addresses across top
    populated devices and a count of MAC addresses by day over the current month:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" >   
   <tr>   
    <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b>Note: </b><br />
      Total MAC Address figures include duplicates &amp; are
        designed to show a &ldquo;saturation level&rdquo; over time.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image039.jpg" border="0" width="350" /></center>
<p>There are a number of
  links from the Interface level summary, and a useful report can be the list of
  &ldquo;Down interfaces&rdquo;:</p>
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image040.jpg" border="0" width="350" /></center>
<p>The &ldquo;Down
  Interfaces&rdquo; report can be a useful guide to interfaces that have been down or
  unused over a period of time, potentially making them candidates as &ldquo;free
  ports&rdquo; available for use.</p>
    <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image041.jpg" border="0" width="350" /></center>

<p>Clicking the
  device, interface or other link will swap the user into the operational view of
  the item in question.</p>

<h2>Operations</h2>
<p><span style='line-height:115%'>In
  addition to reporting, MAC Auditor provides detailed forensics to allow users
  to logically drill down from Sites to devices to VLANs, interfaces or MACs. Users
  can relate usernames to IP addresses, so from a site, quickly locate a user and
  how they are connected to the network. </span></p>
<p><span style='line-height:115%'>Starting
  from the view and month selector, navigation is simply an exercise in clicking
  hyperlinks. Selecting a Site in the Sites frame will give a Site overview
  report in the information frame, and list the member devices in the display
  frame. </span></p>
<p><span style='line-height:115%'>Selecting
  a device will show a device overview interface statistic and lists of the
  interfaces and VLANs on the device: </span></p>
<p><span style='line-height:115%'>Device
  attributes provides device level information; showing the hostname, IP
  address/DNS name, OiD type and a description. All information in the device
  attributes area is searchable. </span></p>
<p><span style='line-height:115%'>Below
  the device attributes, is a summary of Interfaces, VLAN and MAC&rsquo;s for the
  device: </span></p>
<p><span style='line-height:115%'>The
  Interface section provides a quick view of interfaces, real-time status, recent
  device status, type, MAC and IP related information for each interface. Hyperlinks
  allow drilldown to VLAN, MAC, and IP for further detailed information. </span></p>
<p><span style='line-height:115%'>Clicking
  the current status link causes a chart to pop-up with a history of interface
  status over the last month. Each graph shows a 7 day view: </span></p>
<p><a name="_Ref230429202" id="_Ref230429202"></a><a name="_Ref230429200" id="_Ref230429200">Any field underlined can be selected, so
  from the device level, users can drill to Interface and ultimately MAC, IP and
  User forensics.</a></p>
<p>The device view can also provide information
  on interface status. If you need to see the free ports by Site or device, clicking
  down interfaces will show those interfaces down and how they have been down in the
  current month:</p>
<h3>IP
  Forensics</h3>
<p>From any screen it is possible to drill into
  IP forensics, where details on DNS, UserID, ARP and interfaces are shown for
  the IP address</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>Note: </b></p>
      <p>DNS
        resolution is performed so that if DNS entries for the IP address in
        question exists, it is resolved &ndash; but you cannot search using DNS as DNS is
        not currently stored in the database.</p></td>

<h3>MAC
  forensics</h3>
<p>MAC forensics allows users to review the IP and
  connection history of a MAC address:</p>
<p>The IP details show the history of IP address
  assignment to the MAC address.</p>
<p>Connections show the interfaces (and device)
  that the MAC address has been seen on (The MAC Count shows the total number
  of unique MAC&rsquo;s on the interface). </p>
<p>The Connection history shows the connections over time.</p>
<br
clear="all" style='page-break-before:always' />
<h3>User
  forensics</h3>
<p>User forensics can be used to find the IP
  and hence the MAC history of a UserID. This will be non-zero if  User
  Lookup administration  has been correctly
  configured, and MAC Auditor has had sufficient time to start collecting user
  data from LDAP or log sources:</p>
