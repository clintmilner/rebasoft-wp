  <p>MAC Auditor offers two levels of security – normal user or admin user. Admin users have the ability to create and manage sites, users, devices and communities. Normal users are just able to view reports and information captured by MAC Auditor. This way, administrators could grant access to helpdesk staff without granting privileges to change the MAC Auditor system settings.</p>
<p>Users administration is accessed from the Administration dropdown in the top frame; clicking the arrow:</p>

 <p>Administrators are then presented with Users administration in the information frame. To add a user, simply type a name and password and select whether this user is an admin user via the Admin tick box and then click &ldquo;Add user&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To reset password or delete a user, click on the username from the list (administrators can also promote or demote a user from admin privileges at this stage) </p>
