  <h2><span class="purple"><a name="start"></a>Watch List</span></h2>
  <p>MAC Auditor is able to help track devices on the network.
    Whether users require alerts about a rogue access point, or a stolen Laptop, as
    soon as it is seen on the network, a Watchlist hit is displayed and an alert is
    optionally generated. Clicking on the hyperlink shows a list of watched devices
    and when seen on the network:</p>
      <table width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b>Note: </b><br />
            In V1.72, only administrators can add a watch entry</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
       <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image054.jpg" border="0" width="400"/></center>
  </p>
  <p>Users can click clear to remove the alert or click on the
    MAC address link to see further details on the device. In addition to the web
    screen alert, the current version of MAC Auditor allows alert of a Watchlist
    hit to a Syslog server or other syslog based management system. </p>
  <p>Watch lists can be added via 2 methods. From the MAC
    forensics screen by clicking the &ldquo;Add Watch entry&rdquo; link:</p>
           <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image055.jpg" border="0" /></center>

  <p>Or via the Watchlist admin dropdown:</p>
             <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image056.jpg" border="0" /></center>

  <p>There are two potential phases to adding a Watchlist device:</p>
  <ol><li>Add device (plus a description) to the watch
    list.

  <li>Once
    the watch list device is added, decide on an alerting setting if required.<center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image057.jpg" border="0" /></center></li>
</li>
  <li> Alerts
    for watch lists can be multiple and can be deleted without the Watchlist entry
    being deletes<center><img src="../img/Usermanual_1_72/image058.jpg" border="0" /></center></li>
