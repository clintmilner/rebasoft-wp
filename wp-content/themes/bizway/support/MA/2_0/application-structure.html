  <h2><span class="purple">Application structure</span></h2>
  <p>MAC Auditor has been designed with ease of use in mind. Information is
    displayed both graphically and in table form depending on user requirements.
    The reports view shows summary level in graphical form at the Network, Site and
    Device levels, providing an easily assimilated view of Interfaces and MAC
  addresses.</p>
  <p>The Operations view allows a workflow drill down from Site to Device to details
    via VLAN, Interfaces or MACs. Alternatively users can take advantage of the
  powerful search function.</p>
  <p>The screen shot
  below shows the main areas for interacting with MAC auditor:

  alt="Application structure"/></p>
  <p>The <b>Searches</b> input allows
    searching in the selected month on any string. See Searches for more
  information on searching. </p>
  <p>The <b>Admin selector </b>is<b> </b>only shown to "admin" class users and
    provides the navigation to the Admin &amp; configuration functions in MAC
  Auditor.</p>
  <p> The <b>Sites and Device selector</b> lists
    the sites tree structure and devices contained within site. VLANs, interfaces
    and MAC’s see on each device can be directly accessed from the tree view. See <a href="sites-admin.html">
Sites</a> for more details in setting up and
  administering sites. </p>
  <p>Information selected in the sites and devices frame is then displayed in the <b>Display
  frame</b>.</p>
  <p>Finally, the <b>Status frame</b> displays system information, including license status and utilisation and a
  link to system event alerts.</p>
  <h4>Table sorting</h4>
  <p>Most of the tables in MAC Auditor can be sorted by column; simply click
    the mouse on the desired column heading. The first click will sort from low to
  high, the second from high to low:</p>
   <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image004.jpg" /></center>
  <p>To aid comprehension, lists are paginated. To navigate
  around a list, the table modifier is displayed at the foot of the table:</p>
  <p>By default, 10 list items are displayed, but this can be
  increased by changing the "Show:" value from the dropdown.</p>
     <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image005.jpg" /></center><br /><br />

  <ul>
  <li>The first page of the list can be displayed by clicking: <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image006.png" /></li>
  <li>The last page of the list can be displayed by clicking: <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image007.png" /></li>
  <li>The previous page of the list can be displayed by clicking: <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image008.png" /></li>
  <li>The next page of the list can be displayed by clicking: <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image009.png" /></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Navigating reports</h4>
  <p>From each of the graphical reports, it is possible to "zoom" the time frame in and out by selecting in the
    graph. Simply left click at the start &amp; drag the mouse to the desired end
  time frame. The menu will automatically appear showing the options available.</p>
     <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image010.jpg" width="500"/></center>
<br /><br />
      <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
        <tr>
         <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b><i><span
    style='color:red'>Note:</span></i></b>
            <br />When zooming
              on Dashboard, Site or Device overview on one selected report, MAC Auditor
              will automatically zoom other visible reports to the same timeframe</p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br /><br />
           <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image011.jpg" width="400"/></center>

  <p>In addition to zooming, it
  is possible to select reports for the selected site and timeframe.</p>
  <h4>Timeline manipulation</h4>
  <p>In the User, IP, MAC and VLAN forensics reports, MAC Auditor
    displays timelines for easy visual assimilation of information. It is possible
    from these time lines to move back and forward along the time line at a
  particular resolution, and to zoom in or out.</p>
             <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image012.jpg" width="400"/></center><br /><br />

  <p>The default display for all time-lines is 8 days</p>
  <ul>
  <li>To move back along time at the current resolution click <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image013.gif" /></li>
  <li>To move forward along the timeline click the right arrow <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image014.gif" /></li>
  <li>To Zoom out (to view more data on the time line) click <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image015.gif" /></li>
  <li>To Zoom in for more detailed data on the time line click <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image016.gif" />
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>It is also possible
    to view the detailed data behind the time line by clicking "Details" underneath
  the timeline.</p>
               <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image017.jpg" width="400"/></center><br /><br />

<p>To aid visualising
    information on screen, it is also possible to arrange timelines and details to
  suit user requirements in lining up IP and MAC over time.</p>
