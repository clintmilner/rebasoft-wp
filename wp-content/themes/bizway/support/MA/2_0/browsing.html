<h2><span class="purple">Browsing sites and devices</span></h2>
  <p>MAC Auditor allows users to
    logically drill down from Sites to Devices to VLANs, Interfaces or MACs within
    a few clicks. Navigation is simply an exercise in expanding or collapsing sites
    that you have defined, clicking hyperlinks or through the Site visuals. An
    expanded view of all sites/devices can be seen using the collapse/expand all
  controls at the top of the list:</p>
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image018.jpg" /></center>
  <p>If a site is selected, a
    preselected image is displayed in the display frame and child sites and/or
    devices at that level are displayed in the display frame. For example, when USA
    is clicked, a map of the USA, and the sites contained within the USA site are
  displayed. </p>

  <p>A site summary is displayed
    above the map including any White list alerts have been seen. It is also
    possible for users to position sites and devices on the visuals and save them
  for the next user using the "save" icon next to the Site visual. </p>
  <p>Within the Site overview, a
  series of time based summary reports for the site are display:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>MAC Addresses seen</li>
  <li>Top 5 Devices over time</li>
  <li>IP Addresses seen</li>
  <li>Devices seen in use</li>
  <li>Interfaces seen in use</li>
  <li>Interfaces by MAC count</li>
  <li>Interfaces by IP count</li></ul>
  <p>It is also possible to report
    on "Down interface", (this can be used as the basis of a free ports report),
    MAC’s by Vendor, MAC's by IP count, MAC's by Interface count and IP's by MAC
  count.</p>
  <p>From the Sites and devices
    menu, selecting a device will show a device overview, key reports, interface
  statistics and lists of the interfaces and VLANs on the device:</p>
      <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image020.jpg" width="500"/></center>

  <p>"Device attributes" provides
    device level information; showing the hostname, IP address/DNS name, OiD type
    and a description. All information in the device attributes area is searchable
    within the database. For each device, below the device attribute, users can
  view statistics for the device.</p>
  <p>Please note the "Tools"
    line – this is where <a href="help.php?version2.0&integration">3rd Party
    Integration</a> for devices appears. We have
  shown a java SSH/Telnet in the image as an example</p>
  <p>Below the device attributes
    are a series of reports and a list of the active and inactive interfaces for
    the device. In the same way as with Site overview, the reports can be zoomed
  and selected for additional detailed reporting</p>
  <p>MAC
    Auditor also shows the active and inactive interfaces on a device – the image
  below shows areas of interest:</p>

<br /><br />
  <ol>
  <li>To filter on an interface, simply click the
    interface name for the Inteface overview – this will report on MAC address seen
  over time on that interface, IP’s seen, MAC Address vendors.</li>
  <li>To directly list the MAC addresses on the interface click on the number under the
  MAC’s column</li>
  <li>If you
    move the cursor over the Last Changed column, MAC Auditor will display the MAC,
  IP/Netmask (if any) configured for the interface</li>
  <li>Recent
    shows the last 30 minutes of the interface status – in the image above, you can
  see FastEthernet0/3 has been “going up and down”, possibly indicating an issue.</li></ol>
