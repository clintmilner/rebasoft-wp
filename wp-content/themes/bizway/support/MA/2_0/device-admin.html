<h2><span class="purple">Device administration</span></h2>
  <p >Any device that has a CAM table can be a data source for MAC Auditor -
    this might be Layer 3 switch, Router or Firewall. MAC Auditor uses SNMP to poll
    device MIB parameters using RFC standards to retrieve the required information
    from the device. Where a device is not compliant, it is possible to use a
    custom MIB - Rebasoft will consider adding vendor MIBs to Mac Auditor to
    support customer requirements. We have also provided an over-ride to cater to
  devices where the MIB definitions present inconsistent results.</p>
  <p >To add, delete or manage existing devices, administrators should select
  "Devices" from the administration dropdown &amp; click the arrow: </p>

  <h4>Add a device</h4>
  <p >Devices can be added either directly from their IP address or from their
    assigned DNS name. Administrators can add up to 10 devices via the add device
    button. To add more than 10 devices, it is advisable to use the bulk loading
  dialog. </p>
  <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b><i><span
    style='color:red'>Note:</span></i></b><br />
        To add a device
          (or devices) directly to a site, simply select from the site dropdown. If
          the site selector is "none", the device will be added to the "All devices"
          site only.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p >To add multiple devices, simply separate with a comma; for example
    "router1, switch1, firewall8" will add 3 devices – DNS will resolve the device
    to the current IP address. Up to 10 devices may be added using this method
  using IP addresses. </p>
  <p >To add a range of devices, simply add the start of the range and the end
    of the range separated with a space; for example "1.1.1.1 1.1.1.50" will add and
  scan fifty devices from 1.1.1.1 to 1.1.1.50. </p>
  <p >For multiple ranges, it is recommended that the bulk load facility is
  used.</p>
    <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image071.jpg" width="550"/></center>

  <p >Devices can be bulk loaded by cutting and pasting lines into the Bulk
  load dialog. The format of the load is shown below:</p>
  <p> &lt;ipaddress&gt;:&lt;snmpCommunity&gt;:&lt;SiteName&gt;</p>
  <p>This loads a single IP address per line. If snmpCommunity
    is omitted, MAC auditor uses the system defaults in turn to contact the device.
    If SiteName is omitted, device is added to "All devices". The colon ( : ) is a
    field delimiter. If the site does not currently exist, it will be created
  dynamically</p>
  <p> &lt;ipaddress_start&gt;
  &lt;ipaddress_end&gt;:snmpCommunity:SiteName</p>
  <p >In this case the space between the 2 IP
    addresses indicates that MAC Auditor should add the range of addresses between
  the two. The same provisions apply for snmpCommunity &amp; SiteName</p>
  <p> &lt;ipaddress_1&gt;,&lt;ipaddress_2&gt;,&lt;ipaddress_3&gt;:&lt;snmpCommunity&gt;:&lt;SiteName&gt;</p>
  <p >A set of IP addresses separated by commas
    constitutes a list to be processed.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h4>Changing device settings</h4>
  <p >Once a device has been added to the MAC Auditor database, certain
  settings can be overridden. </p>
  <p >It is possible to enable or disable a device, simply tick the enable
    box, and then click the ”<b>Save device”</b> button. Failure to click the save device button will cause changes to be lost
  if navigating away from the page:</p>
    <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image072.jpg" width="550" /></center>

  <p><b>"Rescan"</b> will cause the device to be polled using SNMP.</p>
  <p><b>"Save device"</b> will cause the device updated information
    to be to be saved to the database. Navigation away from this page without
  saving changes causes them to be lost.</p>
  <p ><b>"Remove device"</b> deletes the device from MAC Auditor, but
    does not delete the device data collected in the current month. Removing a
    device will stop it being polled for information. A removed device / interface
    will not count towards the license count, but will still appear in the
  sites/devices list.</p>
  <p ><b>"Remove device and data"</b> removes all device and information
    collected via that device from the MAC Auditor system for the current month.
    Any data collected via a different device will still remain in the database.
    Hence MAC, IP and UserID data will still remain in the system if it has been
  collected via another device.</p>
  <p ><b>"Test device"</b> immediately contacts the device using the configured SNMP community. If successful, the pop-up will show device and interface details.</p>
  <p >It is also possible to override standard interface names and add
  descriptions to aid users:</p>
  <p>If the interface
    index, or retrieved parameter does not match the desired display,
  administrators can override the "ifindex", name and description displayed. </p>
  <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td class="box"><b><i><span style='color:red; font-size:0.8em;' >Note:</span></i></b><br />
        <p>The
          labels in the reports will be marked with * to differentiate the interface
          from polled information.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Use of this
    facility should be carefully considered as reports against interfaces may not
  be accurately shown.</p>
