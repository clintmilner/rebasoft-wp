  <p>From
    any screen it is possible to drill into IP forensics, where details on DNS,
  UserID, ARP and interfaces are shown for the IP address.</p>

            DNS resolution
              is performed so that if DNS entries for the IP address in question exist, it
              is resolved - but you cannot search using DNS as DNS is not currently
              stored in the database.</td>

  <p>Where possible, MAC Auditor will show last
    seen MAC to IP association. If the ARP information for the Last Seen MAC is not
  collected by the system, MAC Auditor cannot display this information.</p>
  <p>Below the Last Seen entry, MAC Auditor will
    show if there is any user association with the IP address, and show, over time,
    which users have been associated with the IP address. The User or green bar can
    be clicked to navigate to <a href="help.php?version=2.0&user-forensics">User
  forensics </a>.</p> <p>IP forensics shows the ARP information for
  IP relation to MAC address, and where that MAC address has been seen over time.</p>

  <p>On IP forensics and IP address lists <a href="help.php?version=2.0&active-tests">Active
    Tests </a>, if configured for the
    IP range selected, are executed, and the results displayed. See Active
    Tests for a detailed
