<h2><span class="purple">Installation of License key</span></h2>
  <p>When accessing the MAC Auditor web interface for
    the first time, it runs in trial mode - this means it will operate for a period
    of 7 days unless a license key is applied to the system. License administration
  is accessed from the Admin dropdown in the top frame, by clicking the arrow:</p>
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image057.jpg" /></center>
  <p>To add a license,
    simply cut and paste the license string into the "New License" box and click
  "load license". </p>
    <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image058.jpg" /></center>

  <p>The license will
    validate and confirmation of the system license will be displayed. If the
    license level is exceeded, MAC Auditor will not collect information from the
  additional interfaces until a new key is obtained from a MAC Auditor reseller.</p>

    If an invalid license is applied, or a version mismatch is detected,
          MAC Auditor will write a message to the MAC Auditor log, located in
          SYSTEM32 directory and will not perform any further polling until a valid
          license is loaded</td>

            If
              the license is being updated on an expired system, the MAC Auditor service
              must be restarted to re-enable device polling.</td>

  <h4>Licensing</h4>
  <p>Rebasoft license MAC Auditor on the number of interfaces
    counted on the devices that are polled by it to collect information. For an
  interface to be counted for license purposes it must conform to the following:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>The interface must be up (down interfaces do not
  count towards license)</li>
  <li>The interface must have a MAC address (virtual
  interfaces which do not have a MAC address assigned by the device do not count)</li>
  <li>The MAC address must be unique (MAC addresses
  that are used across a number of interfaces are only counted once)</li></ol>
  <p>MAC Auditor shows, for each device configured in Device administration
    how many interfaces are counted. The license evaluation is re-calculated each
  time the device is polled:</p>
