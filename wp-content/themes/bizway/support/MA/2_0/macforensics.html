<p>MAC
    Auditor shows the MAC address, and from the Vendor lookup facility, the Vendor
  or Manufacturer that has the IP Address assigned. </p>
<p>If
    there is an ARP entry on a device for the MAC address, MAC Auditor will show
    the IP address allocation history of the MAC address. The IP details show the
  history of IP address assignment to the MAC address. </p>

    <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image027.jpg" width="500"/></center>
<p>The Connection history shows the
    connections over time. This is available in graphical timeline view, or tabular
  view if details are selected.</p>
<p>Connections
    show the interfaces (and device) that the MAC address has been seen on (The MAC
  Count shows the total number of unique MAC’s also on the interface). </p>
