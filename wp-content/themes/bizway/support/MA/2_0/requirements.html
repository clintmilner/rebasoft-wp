<h2><span class="purple">Minimum System Requirements</span></h2>
  <p>The type of system
    required to run MAC Auditor depends on the number of devices to be polled for
    management reporting. The following requirements are a guideline; the only way
    to determine requirements is by testing the software’s performance in a
    specific network environment. To this end Rebasoft has packaged a 7-day trial
  download.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Dual core Intel Xeon or AMD similar processor.</li>
  <li>2Gb RAM, although performance will benefit from
  increased RAM, as data is cached in memory prior to writing to the database.</li>
  <li>120 Gb SATA 7200rpm+ disk (or greater depending on
  network size and period of storage).</li>
  <li>Windows 2003/2008 server.</li>
  <li>Java Runtime (JRE) V1.6 (or later) installed - if not installed will be installed by installer</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL - if not installed will be installed by installer</li>
  <li>Internet
      Explorer V6 or later, Mozilla V3 or later (JavaScript must enabled in the
      browser).</li>
  <li>1200 x 1024 pixel screen
  resolution is recommended for client devices accessing MAC Auditor.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>MAC Auditor is supported in
  a VMware environment.</p>
  <h4>System parameters</h4>
  <p>MAC Auditor relies on SNMP
    polling device CAM tables as part of information collection. The software has
    been extensively tested in large networks and against different device types
    and vendors. System parameters are set as a result of the testing and in line
  with system recommendations below.</p>
  <p>Experience shows that it
    takes around 1 minute for a device to respond to poll of the CAM table. The
    system default is for the polling cycle to be completed every 30 minutes. The
    objective therefore is to set the number of concurrent poller threads to be
    sufficient to complete to information collection and processing within the
  allotted time. </p>
  <p>We recommend that 1 thread
    be allowed for each 10 devices to be polled. The installation default is for 20
    threads, this would allow support of up to 200 devices (with between 5000 and
    8000 interfaces). The thread count can be increased subject to network and
  server load considerations.</p>
