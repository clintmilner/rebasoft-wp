<h2>System settings administration</h2>
  <p>One of the first actions recommended is the configuration of system
    settings. System level settings are used throughout the application. Here
  administrators can set-up:</p>
  <ul><li>System SNMP Community strings</li>
  <li>Alert defaults</li>
  <li>MAC Vendor table</li></ul>
  <p>System settings are accessed from the Administration dropdown in the top
  frame (clicking the arrow):</p>

  <p>A summary of the
    current system settings and directory locations are shown at the bottom of the
  system settings page:</p>

  <h4>System SNMP Community strings</span></h4>
  <p>System level SNMP community strings are used during initial device
    polling. SNMP strings, if entered during device input, are used first. In the
    absence of a specified SNMP community string, system level SNMP communities are
    used in turn until a successful poll is performed. MAC Auditor then stores the
    successful string with the device, this reduces the number of alerts that a
    device might generate if a community is used unsuccessfully.  It is only necessary to use Read-only
  strings. </p>
  <p >To add a new community simply type the string into the box &amp; click
  "Add community"</p>
  <p>To remove a
  community, simply click the cross next to the string to be removed:</p>

  <h4>System Alerts</span></h4>
  <p>The current release of MAC Auditor has provision for alerting using
    syslog. Administrators can set multiple syslog servers depending on network
    preferences. To enter a syslog server, simply specify a name, required level
    and facility together with the target address. Administrators can also set the
  syslog level and facility to suit any log processing or alert handling system.</p>
  <p>Syslog server
    receivers can be removed by simply clicking the cross next to the syslog to be
  removed:</p>

  <h4>MAC Address - Company ID</h4>
  <p>IEEE maintains an
    index of MAC address prefixes in relation to Vendors. This index changes from
    time-to-time, and any new release of MAC Auditor will contain the latest index.
    If, however, you search MAC Auditor and see a MAC address without a vendor entry,
  it may be that the index is out-of-date. </p>

    a large file, a facility to download and update MAC Auditor on request if
  available:</p>
