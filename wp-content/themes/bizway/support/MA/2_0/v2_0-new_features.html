<h2><span class="purple">New features for V2</span></h2>
  <p>MAC Auditor V2 sees
    the introduction of new features built upon the previous release and based upon
    customer requests and requirements:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Active test<br />active test allows the administrator to set up, on a per subnet basis, a
    connectivity test base upon a port number - this allows an operator to
    determine whether an IP address is currently active on the network and which
    ports are available on that IP. Quick service check - cross check with NetFlow</li>
  <li>White list<br />allows an administrator to watch a site and report on any newly discovered
    MAC addresses, and alert on it.</li>
    <li>Sites:<ul>
 <li style="font-size:1.3em;">Nesting of sites<br />allows a structure of sites and devices to be set-up to match your
    network topography </li>
   <li  style="font-size:1.3em;">Visuals and maps related to sites<br />allows administrators to set a visual view for each
    site and arrange child sites and devices on that visual - as an aid to help MAC
    Auditor users to quickly assimilate physical location information about the
    site or sites.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>PostgreSQL database</li></ul>
    <p>To support these new
    features, there have been a number of minor changes to the application which
    are described in the sections below. Please see V2.0 <a href="../../docs/support/releasenotes_2_0.pdf" target="_blank">release notes</a></p>
