<h2><span class="purple">Watch list</span></h3>
  <p>MAC Auditor is able to help
    track devices on the network. Whether users require alerts about a rogue access
    point, or a stolen Laptop, as soon as it is seen on the network, a Watch list alert
    is displayed and an syslog alert is optionally generated. Clicking on the
  hyperlink shows a list of watched devices and when seen on the network: </p>
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image035.jpg" width="500"/></center>
  <p>Users can click manage the alert
  or click on the MAC address link to see further details on the device. </p>
  <p>Watch lists can be added via 2
  methods. <ul><li>From the MAC forensics screen by clicking the "Add Watch entry" link:<br /><br />
    <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image036.jpg"width="400" /></center></li>

 <li>Or via the Watch list
  admin drop down: <br /><br /> <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image037.jpg" /></center></li></ul>
  <br /><br />
      <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8EM;"><b><i><span
    style='color:red'>Note:</span></i></b><br />Only
              administrators can add a watch entry</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
  <p>Watch lists are configured in the following screen:</p>
 <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image038.jpg" width="500"/></center>
 <p>Add
  device (plus a description) to the watch list.</p>
  <p>Once
  the watch list device is added, decide on an alerting setting if required.</p>
 <p>Alerts
    for watch lists can be multiple and can be deleted without the Watch list entry
  being deleted.</p>
<p>Alerts are only sent when a MAC address is first
  seen by the MAC Auditor</p>
  <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8EM;"><b><i><span style='color:red'>Note:</span></i></b><br />
        Restarting MAC Auditor
          does not cause generation of new alerts as the system retains Watchlist
          status information in the database.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p >If a previously seen MAC
    address leaves the network (for the CAM hold down period) and MAC Auditor is
    then restarted you will, of course, generate an alert as this would be classed
    as a new Watchlist hit.
  </p>
  <p >The syslog message will be
  sent as:<BR /><BR />
