<h2><span class="purple"><a name="start"></a>Active Tests</span></h2>
  <p>Active test provides the ability to immediately test the
    presence of an IP address and availability of TCP ports on that IP address or
    subnet in real time. With SNMP methods of polling IP addresses, the data can be
    5 minutes or more out of date and typically just provides a record of an IP
  address being present on the network in the past.</p>

  <p>Active Test goes further; in that an administrator can
    define a series of tests to verify the availability of a TCP port, and the
  response time of those tests.</p>

        <br />Active Test is only initiated by the operator via the web browser
          session. Active test is activated only from IP forensics in a subnet with
          Active tests configured, or commanded via the "Active Test All" button when
          displaying a list of IP addresses in a search result.</td>

  <p>Active Test works by sending a SYN to the target IP address
    and port. If the port connection is made, Rebasoft Auditor closes the session and
    records the response time. If the IP/port does not respond, only the single
    packet is sent and no retransmission occurs. This way, the network overhead is
  negligible.</p>
  <p>Active Test provides 2 key benefits:
  <ol>
  <li>In the absence of any other tools, active test
    verifies the instant status of a remote IP address, avoiding the need to deploy
    cable test for initial diagnosis. This speeds up the process of problem
    solving. The port test can also verify the correct services are showing as
  available - a possible indication of correct functioning of the remote device.</li>
  <li>Active
    test can also verify which ports at the end device are available. Active Test
    can therefore be a security tool to identify end device ports that should not
    be available - a possible indication of miss-configuration, presence of malware
  or even presence of a rogue device.</li></ol>
