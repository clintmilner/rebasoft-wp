<h2><span class="purple">3rd Party Integration</span></h2>
  <p>Rebasoft Auditor is an open
    application and has been designed with powerful integration facilities.
    Integration can be at the MAC, IP, Interface or Device level. Integration can
  be selected via the Admin dropdown:</p>
  <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_1/image053.png" /></center>
  <p>To enable integration, select the type required, and provide a name. This name will be displayed on
  the appropriate page under tools:</p>
  <p>Simply add the desired URL.
  Rebasoft Auditor provides four main variables: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>REBA_MAC - passes the current MAC address to the UR</li>
  <li>REBA_IP - passes the current IP address to the URL</li>
  <li>REBA_DEVICE - passes the device IP address to URL</li>
  <li>REBA_INTERFACE - passes the interface index to the URL</li></ul>
  <p>Integrations can be added
    or deleted, or if the same name is inputted for an existing device, MAC, IP or
  interface integration, overwritten.</p>
  <p>Once added, the integration appears as a "tool" at the IP, MAC, Device
  or interface level:</p>

  <p>While there are no limits to the number or types of integrations
    available, Rebasoft recommend no more than 4 or 5 per level be configured to
  maintain clarity during application use.</p>
  <p>3rd Party integration can happen in reverse. All reports and screens
    within Rebasoft Auditor are accessible via a URL. Hence it is possible to call MAC
    Auditor from any web application. For example, a search with a search parameter
  can be called via a URL from any web application:</p>
  <p><code>http://&lt;server_IP&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/?action=Seach&amp;SearchValue=&lt;any
    argument&gt; </code>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Calling Rebasoft Auditor from other applications</h3>
  <p>In order to comply with the design goal of being open, all reports and links  within Rebasoft Auditor are accessible via a URL. Hence it is possible to call Rebasoft  Auditor from any web application. For example, a search with a search parameter  can be called via a URL from any web application:<br />
    http://&lt;server_IP&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/?action=Seach&amp;SearchValue=&lt;any  argument&gt; <br />
    To aid security, and prevent users accessing Auditor from a  system which they have already authenticated to, there is now the ability to  embed portal users credentials into the url of a link called by the 3rd  party application. The portal user settings are set within User administration  by simply adding a user name and IP address to the portal users dialog.<br />
  </p>
      <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_1/portal_user.jpg" /></center>

  <p>
    The url called must include the &ldquo;portalUser=&lt;User  Name&gt;&rdquo; parameter within the string. Where the &lt;user name&gt; is  configured as above. Security is also provided by the addition of the source IP  address from which the portal user is called from. </p>
