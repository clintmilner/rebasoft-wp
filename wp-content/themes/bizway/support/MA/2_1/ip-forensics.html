<h2><span class="purple">IP Forensics</span></h2>
  <p>From any screen it is possible to drill into IP forensics, where details on DNS,
  UserID, ARP and interfaces are shown for the IP address.</p>
    <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image022.jpg" width="500"/></center>
  <p>Where possible, Rebasoft Auditor will show last seen MAC to IP association. If the ARP information for the Last Seen MAC is not
  collected by the system, Rebasoft Auditor cannot display this information.</p>
  <p>Below the Last Seen entry, Rebasoft Auditor will
    show if there is any user association with the IP address, and show, over time,
    which users have been associated with the IP address. The User or green bar can
    be clicked to navigate to <a href="help.php?version=2.1&user-forensics">User
  forensics </a>.</p> <p>IP forensics shows the ARP information for
  IP relation to MAC address, and where that MAC address has been seen over time.</p>

  <p>On IP forensics and IP address lists <a href="help.php?version=2.1&active-tests">Active
    Tests </a>, if configured for the
    IP range selected, are executed, and the results displayed. See <a href="help.php?version=2.1&active-tests">Active
    Tests</a> for a detailed description on how this operates.</p>
