<h2><span class="purple">License administration</span></h2>
<p>Rebasoft Auditor's license is deeply embedded within the application. License information is constantly evaluated as devices are polled for SNMP information. The active interfaces for a device are updated and added to the total count for all devices polled; so from hour to hour and day to day, the number of active interfaces will vary.</p>
<p>When the number of active interfaces polled exceeds the licensed number of interfaces, the data for interfaces in excess of the license maximum are not stored in the database for that polling period. If, subsequently, the total number (including the &quot;extra ones&quot; fall below the license level, data will once again be written to the database)

Polling of interfaces from a device happens in the order the device presents the data to Auditor, this varies by vendor. Devices are polled in sequence, typically every 30 minutes.
