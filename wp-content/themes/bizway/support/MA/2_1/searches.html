<h2><span class="purple">Searches</span></h2>
  <p>Rebasoft Auditor's powerful search engine allows users to search for any string in the
    currently database. Most users will use the search as way to quickly navigate
    to the point of interest. Searches return results in for MAC, User ID, IP
  address, Devices, Interfaces and VLANS: </p>
  
  
      <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b><i><span style='color:red'>Tip:</span></i></b><br />
          If you click
              the search button without entering any parameters, Rebasoft Auditor returns a
              search of all entries in the database.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br /><br />
      <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image031.jpg" width="200"/></center>
<p>From here it is matter of clicking on the area of interest to drill down to detailed
  forensic information.</p>
  <p>Searching is not limited by time for results,
    hence any information associated with IP, Users, MACs, device details,
  interface details or vlan details are catalogued for searching.</p>

<br /><br />
      <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td class="box" style="font-size:0.8em;"><b><i><span style='color:red'>Tip:</span></i></b><br />
           You can search for multiple IP addresses by entering a comma between desired IP's</p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    
  <p>
    Only when you select a search result does Rebasoft Auditor query the database
    (default 8 days) to see when the item occurred. Information displayed in
    timelines allows users to view longer or short periods of time as required.
    Using this method Rebasoft Auditor, for example, does require users to know when
  someone was on the network to see if they've ever logged in.</p>
  <p>Searching
    can be improved by specifying a string or partial string match to be searched
    on. For example, searching on "10.100.1" will bring up all the matching
  records with the string - in this case matching IP addresses and devices.</p>
  <p>Searching the database in
    this way would allow help desk staff to quickly identify a user from Active
    directory, to IP address to MAC to physical location and network port. Active
  test can then verify the status of the device.</p>
