<h2><span class="purple">User administration</span></span></a></h2>
<p>Rebasoft Auditor offers two levels of security - normal user or admin user.
  Admin users have the ability to create and manage sites, users, devices and
  communities. Normal users are just able to view reports and information
  captured by Rebasoft Auditor. This way, administrators could grant access to
  helpdesk staff without granting privileges to change the Rebasoft Auditor system
  settings.</p>
<p>Users administration is accessed from the Administration dropdown in the
  top frame; clicking the arrow:</p>

<p>Administrators are then presented with Users administration in the
  information frame:</p>
<p>To add a user, simply type a name and password and select whether this
  user is an admin user via the Admin tick box and then click "Add user".</p>

<p>To reset password
  or delete a user, click on the username from the list (administrators can also
  promote or demote a user from admin privileges at this stage).</p>
