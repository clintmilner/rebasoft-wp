<h2><span class="purple">User forensics</span></h2>
  <p>User
    forensics can be used to find the IP and hence the MAC history of a UserID. User
    forensics whill show the last seen connection for the user - relating UserID,
    to IP address, to MAC Address to Device and interface. Device and Interface
    details will only be shown if Rebasoft Auditor is collecting information from the
  device that the users is connected to. </p>

  <p>User forensics will be populated only if User
    Lookup administration has been correctly
    configured, and Rebasoft Auditor has had sufficient time to start collecting user
  data from LDAP or security event log sources.</p>
