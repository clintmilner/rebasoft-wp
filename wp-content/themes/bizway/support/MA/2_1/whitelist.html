<h2><span class="purple">White list</span></h2>
<p>While list is selectable by site, and is a facility to generate alerts on new devices accessing the network at that site. For example if you have a locked down standard build for a remote location, you can use MAC Auditor to alert on any device not previously seen connecting to the network at that site. White list alerts are reported to the Site overview screen, the events system and, optionally, a syslog receiver.</p>

<p>White lists are configured by accessing the admin selector:</p>

<p>White list settings provide the ability to start, stop and reset White list monitoring. If a configured site has one or more devices being polled by MAC Auditor, monitoring can be activated by clicking the "Monitor" button.</p>

<p>If an asset system already records the MAC address of devices, these can be manually added to MAC Auditor via the "Add" button.</p>

<p>Once monitoring has been activated new devices seen are alerted to the event subsystem, where the device, interface and MAC address are shown. Users can click the MAC address to view MAC forensics

<p>White lists, once set up can be changed and updated via the White list administration dialog: </p>

<p>Newly discovered MAC addresses can be automatically included in the White list by clicking the "Reset" button. Users can also add a list of MAC addresses by clicking the "Add" button.</p>
<p>MAC addresses can be added singly to the White list by selecting them from the "new" list</p>

<p>Individual MAC addresses can be added by clicking "Add to White list"</p>
