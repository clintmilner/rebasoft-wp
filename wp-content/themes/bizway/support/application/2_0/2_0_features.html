<h1><span class="purple">Application Auditor Overview</span></h1>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>Application Auditor is designed to use multiple sources of data from your network infrastructure to report on application usage. With application usage information organisations can:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>understand and enforce acceptable use policies</li>
				<li>troubleshoot performance issues</li>
				<li>improve perimeter security</li>
				<li>identify potential zero day threats</li>
				<li>and more</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Application Auditor provides the ability to both generate summary executive reports as well as facilitating deep, dive forensic analysis down to individual network conversations.</p>

				<p>Application Auditor, as a single environment provides a future proof, multi-platform coverage system. This saves organisations:</span></p>
				<ul>
				<li>money in procuring and maintaining multiple systems</li>
				<li>time and effort in deploying and learning multiple, disparate toolsets</li></ul>
				<p>Closely coupled with Rebasoft’s Auditor Core, it is now possible to obtain true end-to-end view:</span></p>
				<ol>
				<li>Who (user awareness)</li>
				<li>What (physical device type)</li>
				<li>Where (location awareness)</li>
				<li>Which application has been accessed</li>
				<li>When, over time</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h2>Key Features</h2>
				<p>Application Auditor has been designed to be quickly deployed with or without SNMP access to source devices. Application Auditor can take information from firewalls, routers, network switches, WAN acceleration systems, proxy servers and more.</p>
				<p>Key features of Auditor include:</p>
				<ul>
                <li>Support for multiple sources: 
                <ul>

				 <li>Firewall logs (Juniper, Cisco ASA -   NSEL Format)</li>
				 <li>Proxy server logs (Squid, Ironport)</li></ul></li>
				<li>Summary reports by device, interface and Subnet</li>
				<li>Forensic reports with drill down</li>
				<li>Define custom applications</li>
				<li>Restrict access by user login</li>
