				<p>Receivers are the mechanism for which listening ports on your Application Auditor server are created. Receiver settings are found within Receivers Admin section. To add a new Receiver, enter the Name of your Receiver and specify both the listening port and data type from the drop-down list. Either Netflow/IPFix or Syslog are currently accepted data formats.</p>

				<p>Select ‘Add Receiver’ and a new Receiver is created, ready to accept inbound communications from your external sources. When you are happy with your configuration you can start your receiver by selecting the green ‘start’ arrow shown under the ‘Action’ column.

				<p>Subnet Settings</p>
				<p>Subnet administration allows you to specify which network segments you wish to monitor and report upon within Application Auditor. If subnets are overlapping, this can be addressed by the specification of devices and interfaces on which the subnet data has been collected. In addition to filtering views of both monitored and un-monitored subnets, reporting displays device and interface statistics where an available subnet has been seen on a device which is currently being monitored.</p>

			<div class="story">
				<p>System Settings</p>
				<p>There are a number of system settings that can be viewed and managed within the web interface of Application Auditor. Data storage, reporting options, SNMP &amp; DNS all have variable parameters that can be set within this section.</p>
				<p>To access these views, select the ‘System Settings’ section from the Admin selector:</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p>Storage Settings</p>
				<p>To allow optimisation of database storage there are two configurable options within the Storage Settings section of the System Settings. These settings only impact the retention of forensic flow records, and not summarised report data. The forensic data represents the bulk of data storage required. </p>
				<p>• Storage duration (default 7 days) and </p>
				<p>• Minimum packet size for forensic reporting (default 0 Bytes). </p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p>If collecting full flow forensics for all flow sizes, you can set the stroage duration. Once the time limit has been reached, application auditor will begin discarding older forensic data. This prevents disk filling up and more current data being lost.</p>
				<p/>
				<p>The second option will allow you to dramatically increase your storage capabilities through non-storage of smaller Byte flow records. If you wish to store all records within your database, leave this option set to the default value (0).</p>
				<p>. </p>
				<p>For example, Rebasoft has seen, on average, packet sizes of 500 bytes or less will take up 36% of storage on disk (assuming 120 bytes per ipfix flow record).  Hence on a 500Gb database, 180Gb of data can be saved.</p>
				<p>Organisations can therefore trade packet size with time that forensics records are stored in order to meet the forensic record storage requirements and storage limitations.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p>It will take a minimum of 1 hour for application auditor to start showing information in subnet reports. IP’s seen should indicate that data is being collected before graphical reports are available.</p>

				<p>License Administration</p>
				<p>Application Auditor’s license is deeply embedded within the application. License information is constantly evaluated as source data is received.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="story">
				<p>Licensing rationale</p>
				<p>Application Auditor is licensed by the total number of sources sending information irrespective of the source IP address. This means that a single network device may act as multiple sources (for example a firewall providing both session log (for NAT information) and NetFlow would count as 2 sources).</p>
				<p/>
				<p>If the license expires, Application Auditor will stop processing and storing new data. If a new source sends data to Application Auditor that exceeds the number or sources licensed, the new source’s data will not be processed.</p>
				<p/>
				<p>Adding a License key</p>
				<p>When accessing the Application Auditor web interface for the first time, it runs in trial mode – this means it will operate for a period of 14 days unless a license key is applied to the system. License administration is accessed in the ‘Licensing’ section of the Admin selector:</p>
