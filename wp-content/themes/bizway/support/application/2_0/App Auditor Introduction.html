			<div class="story">
				<p>Application Auditor is designed to use multiple sources of data from your network infrastructure to report on application usage. With application usage information organisations can:</p>
				<p>• understand and enforce acceptable use policies</p>
				<p>• troubleshoot performance issues</p>
				<p>• improve perimeter security</p>
				<p>• identify potential zero day threats</p>
				<p/>
				<p>Application Auditor provides the ability to both generate summary executive reports as well as facilitating deep, dive forensic analysis down to individual network conversations.</p>
				<p>Application Auditor, as a single environment provides a future proof, multi-platform coverage system, saving organisations:</p>
				<p>• money in procuring and maintaining multiple systems</p>
				<p>• time and effort in deploying and learning multiple, disparate toolsets</p>
				<p/>
				<p>Closely coupled with Rebasoft’s Auditor Core, it is now possible to obtain true end-to-end view:</p>
				<p>1) Who (user awareness)</p>
				<p>2) What (physical device type)</p>
				<p>3) Where (location awareness)</p>
				<p>4) Which application has been accessed</p>
				<p>5) When, over time</p>
