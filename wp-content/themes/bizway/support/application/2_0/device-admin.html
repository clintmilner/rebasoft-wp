<h1><span class="purple">Device Settings</span></h1>
				<p>Once a device has been configured to export flow information to Application Auditor, it is automatically  registered by the system. Device settings allows administrators to fine-tune  and  configure  settings on a per device basis as needed. To access device settings, select 'Devices' from the Admin drop down</p><center><img src="2_0/images/config%20and%20admin%20device%20settings.png"/></center>
			
				<p>In Device settings, Application Auditor displays the list of automatically discovered devices together with other pertinent information. Application Auditor shows this summary in a table showing the type of data being received (and the number of packets received) together with SNMP polling statistics (if any): </p>
                <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%">
                <tr valign="middle">
                <td style="background:#ff9900;" valign="top" ><span style="color:#fff; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;">note:</span></td>
                <td style="border: 1px solid #ff9900;">A device can export more than one source of application flow data (for example a Juniper Networks SRX can export jFLow, AppSecure and Firewall session logs - this single devoice would count as 3 sources for licensing purposes)</td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>To edit a device, simply select from the list. Administrators can configure the following elements:</p>
				<ul>
                <li>Override the Display Name</li>
				<li>Set SNMP Version (1, 2 or 3)</li>
				<li>Device specific SNMP Community</li>
				<li>Sampling rate override (if required)</li>

                <p>Administrators can also override interface details â€“ Alias, Speed &amp; Monitored Subnets (when successful SNMP communication has been established Application Auditor will display the results gathered from the device):

				<p>In addition to the interface you will be presented with a list of discovered subnets &amp; Netmask against the Interface that has seen them, this allows fast specification of subnets for reporting purposes:</p>

You can also choose to monitor multiple subnets by selecting the Interface Monitor checkbox and selecting 'Monitor Subnets' as shown:</p>
