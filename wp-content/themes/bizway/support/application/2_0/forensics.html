<h1><span class="purple">Forensics</span></h1>
				<p>Forensics are accessible from devices and interfaces, and allow users to access the raw data collected. Forensics allows a series of reports to be run that can isolate activity down to a single url accessed at a point in time where the data is stored. See <a href="help.php?version=2.0&reportindex">Appendix 2</a> (forensics reports by data type) for a list of available report by data collection type:</p>

                <p>When in forensics, reports can be selected and filters applied. Reports are available as graphs, or access to raw data can be achieved by selecting tabular data. </p>

				<p>Filters can be applied by selecting the field from the drop down, and entering the required data:</p>
