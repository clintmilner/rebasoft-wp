<h1><span class="purple">License
Administration</span></h1>
<p>Rebasoft
  Auditor's license is deeply embedded within the application. License
  information is constantly evaluated as devices are polled for SNMP information.
  The active interfaces for a device are updated and added to the total count for
  all devices polled; so from hour to hour and day to day, the number of active
  interfaces will vary.</p>
<p>When the
  number of active interfaces polled exceeds the licensed number of interfaces,
  the data for interfaces in excess of the license maximum are not stored in the
  database for that polling period. If, subsequently, the total number (including
  the extra ones fall below the license level, data will once again be written
    to the database) Polling of interfaces from a device happens in the order the
    device presents the data to Auditor, this varies by vendor. Devices are polled
    in sequence, typically every 30 minutes. </p>
<h2>Adding a License key</h2>
<p>When
  accessing the Rebasoft Auditor web interface for the first time, it runs in
  trial mode &ndash; this means it will operate for a period of 7 days unless a license
  key is applied to the system. License administration is accessed from the Admin
  dropdown in the top frame, by clicking the arrow:</p>
  <center><img src="2_2/images/image016.png" /></center>
<p>To add a license, simply cut and paste the license
  string into the &ldquo;New License&rdquo; box and click &ldquo;load license&rdquo;. </p>
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image017.jpg" /></center>

<p>The license will validate and confirmation of the
  system license will be displayed. If the license level is exceeded, Rebasoft
  Auditor will not collect information from the additional interfaces until a new
  key is obtained from a Rebasoft Auditor reseller.</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p>Rebasoft license
  Rebasoft Auditor on the number of interfaces counted on the devices that are
  polled by it to collect information. For an interface to be counted for license
  purposes it must conform to the following:</p>
  
<ol>
<li>The
  interface must be up (down interfaces do not count towards the license)</li>
  <li>The
  interface must have a MAC address (virtual interfaces which do not have a MAC
  address assigned by the device do not count)</li>
  <li>The
  MAC address must be unique (MAC addresses that are used across a number of
  interfaces are only counted once)</li></ol>
<p>Rebasoft Auditor
  shows, for each device configured in Device administration how many interfaces are counted. The license evaluation is
    re-calculated each time the device is polled:</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image019.jpg" vspace="8" width="400"/></center>

<p>You can check the
  license count for each device on the license count link against each device
  polled:</p>
      <center><img src="2_2/images/image020.jpg" vspace="8" width="400" /></center>

<p>This shows each
  interface that has been used since the Rebasoft Auditor service was started and
  the number of MAC addresses recently seen by it, this gives a visual indication
  of where interfaces are uplinks. </p>
