                <p>Receivers are the mechanism for which listening ports on your Application Auditor server are created. Receiver settings are found within Receivers Admin section. To add a new Receiver, enter the Name of your Receiver and specify both the listening port and data type from the drop-down list. Either Netflow/IPFix or Syslog are currently accepted data formats.</p>

				<p>Select 'Add Receiver' and a new Receiver is created, ready to accept inbound communications from your external sources. When you are happy with your configuration you can start your receiver by selecting the green ‘start’ arrow shown under the 'Action' column. When sources are seen within the parameters of your configured receivers they will be automatically displayed within this page.</p>
