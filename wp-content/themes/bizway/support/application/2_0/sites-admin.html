<h1><span class="purple">Sites administration</span></h1>
  <p>Rebasoft Auditor provides  administrators the ability to model their real-world network with Sites. A Site  is simply a container that can comprise devices and/or other sites (child  sites). The network can therefore be related to physical or logical locations  with, for example, locations being divided into sub-locations that contain  devices. Sites can also be logical groupings or organizations rather than a  location eg. Printers with a sub site of HP Printers. A site can contain both  devices and sub-sites.</p>
<p>Consider the example below:</p>
<center><img src="2_2/images/image106.jpg" width="500"/></center>

  <p>In this case, the
    administrator has defined USA as a top level (or parent) site and New York and
    San Francisco as sub (or child) sites. New York and San Francisco could
  themselves contain child sites and/or devices.</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
  <tr>
<td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
A site can also be assigned a Visual. A Visual is an image file (JPG, PNG,GIF) that is displayed when the site is selected. Visuals are uploaded and assigned when the site is selected</p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
  <p>To access Sites
    administration, select "Sites" from the administration dropdown in the top
  frame and click the arrow:</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image107.png" /></center>

  <p>To add a site, simply type
  a name and click the "Add New Site" button.</p>
<center><img src="2_2/images/image108.jpg" width="150"/></center>

  <p>Once a site has been added it will appear in the Existing
    sites list. Administrators can add or remove a device by using the cursor to
  select a device and add or remove it from the members list.</p>
<center><img src="2_2/images/image109.jpg" width="550"/></center>

  <p>To remove a site, simply  highlight the site &amp; click the &ldquo;Remove site button&rdquo;. Removing a site does  not remove the device or data for that device. The device will remain in any  other site it is a member of, or will appear in &ldquo;Unallocated devices&rdquo; </p>
    <p>To rename a site, simply  highlight the site, type in the new name and click the &ldquo;Rename Site&rdquo; button.</p>
    <p>If any device is not a  member of a parent site, it is accessible via a dynamically created site named  &ldquo;Unassigned Devices&rdquo;. This can be a useful way of tracking any device that is  not a member of any site.</p>
    <p>In the same way a device  can be a member of more than one site, so a site may be a child of one or more  parent sites.</p>
  <p>In the display frame, as  sites are selected, the configured visual is shown. Child sites or devices can  be selected and viewed either by clicking through the map or from the Site and  device selector.</p>
