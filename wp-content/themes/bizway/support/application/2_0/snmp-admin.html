<h1><span class="purple">System settings administration</span></h1>

<p>One of the first actions recommended is the configuration of system
settings. System level settings are used throughout the application. Here
administrators can set-up:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#snmpsettings">SNMP Settings</a></li>
<li><a href="#syslog">Syslog settings</a> for alert output</li>
<li><a href="#settings">Systems settings</a> (these settings are reserved for future use)</li>
<li><a href="#networkdiscovery">Network Discovery</a></li>
<li><a href="#database">Database settings</a></li>
<li><a href="#macvendor">MAC Vendor table</a></li>
<li><a href="#oid-db">OID Vendor database</a></li>
<li><a href="#vendoroid">Vendor OID</a></li>
<li><a href="#logging">Log level settings</a></li>
</ul>
<p>System settings are accessed from the Administration dropdown in the top
frame (clicking the arrow):</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image086.png" /></center>
<p>A summary of the
current system settings and directory locations are shown at the bottom of the
system settings page:</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image087.png" width="550" /></center>
<h2><a id="snmpsettings"></a>SNMP Settings</h2>
<p>SNMP settings allow administrators to control Auditor SNMP settings.
System wide community strings can be set (these can be overridden during device
discovery) as well as enabling overrides for SNMP discovered information. </p>
<p>Auditor can change
device name cases. Administrators can select UPPER or lower cases for storage
and display; in which case following each SNMP poll, Auditor stores the device
name in the required case. "Do nothing" simply accepts the device name
(hostname) as configured from the polled device.</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image088.jpg" width="250" /></center>

<p>Sometimes, for
legibility in Auditor, it is desirable to remove text from the device name.
This may be useful if the device (hostname) is a FQDN format (such as
cat3750-rm104.abcompany.com), you can then remove any desired element (for
example ".abcompany.com") from the device name. This setting is also persistent
even when the device is re-polled by SNMP.</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image089.jpg" width="250"/></center>
<p>SNMP Community strings, if entered during device input, are used first.
In the absence of a specified SNMP community string, system level SNMP
communities are used in turn until a successful poll is performed. Rebasoft
Auditor then stores the successful string with the device, this reduces the
number of alerts that a device might generate if a community is used
unsuccessfully. It is only necessary to
use Read-only strings. </p>

<p>To add a new community simply type the string into the box &amp; click
"Add community"</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image090.jpg" width="300" /></center>

<p>To remove a
community, simply click the cross next to the string to be removed</p>

<h2><a id="networkdiscovery"></a>Network Discovery</h2>

<p>Auditor (V2.2 or later) provides the ability to
automatically discover network devices using Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
and/or Link Layer Discovery Protocol
(LLDP). These protocols rely
upon the network devices to be discovered having CDP or LLDP enabled. The
configuration guides of the various vendors can advise on how CDP/LLDP can be
enabled. </p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image091.png" width="300"/></center>
<p>CDP and LLDP have two operating modes. CDP and LLDP can be
used to add devices to Auditors polling list, and this collects ARP, CAM and
other information from the MIB. In addition CDP and LLDP can be used to resolve
hostnames, such as the phone ID for Cisco IP phones.</p>

<p><a href="help.php?version=2.2&subnets">Subnet filters</a> can be applied to CDP and LLDP settings to limit the bounds of CDP and LLDP
discovery, to reduce traffic and prevent devices inadvertently being added to
Auditor's device list.</p>

<h2><a id="syslog"></a>Syslog settings for Alert</h2>

<p>Rebasoft Auditor currently alerts on screen and using syslog.
Administrators can set multiple syslog servers depending on network
preferences. To enter a syslog server, simply specify a name, required level
and facility together with the target address. Administrators can also set the
syslog level and facility to suit any log processing or alert handling system.
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image092.jpg" width="550"/></center>

<p>Syslog server
receivers can be removed by simply clicking the cross next to the syslog to be
removed</p>

<h2><a id="settings"></a>System Settings</h2>

<p>This shows the current settings as configured during the
installation process:</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image093.png" width="550" /></center>
<p>If it is necessary to amend the no. of threads used or the
RAM allocated to Auditor, simply re-run the installer and plug in the new values.</p>

<h2><a id="database"></a>Database Settings</h2>

<p>Database settings allow administrators to refine and set
controls for the amount of data stored by Auditor. The system comes with a
series of defaults, but depending on organization policy and the amount of disk
available on the Auditor server these settings can be overridden.</p>

    <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
    From Auditor
    2.2 onwards, it is possible to install the Auditor database on a separate
    database server or NAS from the polling engine.
    </td>
   </tr>
  </table>
  <br /><br />
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image094.png" width="550"/></center>

<p>Auditor shows a
list of the largest tables on the system, if space is an issue and these have a
red X beside them, they can be safely removed from the system. They can also be
removed if they are old and no longer required, ( MAC Address - Company ID).</p>
<h2><a id="macvendor"></a>MAC Vendor table</h2>
<p>IEEE maintains an
index of MAC address prefixes in relation to Vendors. This index changes from
time-to-time, and any new release of Rebasoft Auditor will contain the latest
index. If, however, you search Rebasoft Auditor and see a MAC address without a
vendor entry, it may be that the index is out-of-date.</p>

<p>Since this file is
a large file, a facility to download and update Rebasoft Auditor on request if
available:</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image095.jpg" width="550"/></center>

<h2><a id="oid-db"></a>OID Vendor database</h2>
<p>The OID Vendor
database is used for vendors where Auditor needs to create a specific polling
scheme, This dialog allows the Rebasoft development team to rapidly deliver a
specific polling type for new types of vendor hardware.</p>

        <center><img src="2_2/images/image096.png" width="350" /></center>

<h2><a id="vendoroid"></a>Vendor OID</h2>
<p>If a device type is
displaying the OID string as numbers in the device overview page, it is
possible to override this and put a description that may be of more value to
users.</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image097.png" width="300" /></center>

<p>In this case putting "1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.1.1.1.2.36" together
with a vendor and device description would allow administrators to display a
consistent name for the device. </p>

        <center><img src="2_2/images/image098.png" width="300"  /></center>


<p>To change a description, simply input the OID with a new
device and vendor name</p>

<h2><a name="logging"></a>Log settings</h2>

<p>Auditor writes
system and event information to its system log located in %\windows\system32\ -
called RebasoftAuditor.log. The default level is info (and it is recommended it
is left as such unless requested to change it by Rebasoft support). From time
to time it may be necessary to collect and log more information, this can be
set via Log settings, once the log settings have been changed, the Auditor
service needs to be restarted to take effect</p>
