<h1><span class="purple">Subnets</span></h1>
<p>Subnet administration allows you define IP network ranges
  and optionally group together in subnet filters for use in auditor. One reason
  this may be desirable is when defining integrations, where a particular tool or
  application to be called is only relevant to a set of devices in part of the
  network.</p>

<h2>Subnet</h2>
<p>By default, a subnet encompassing all IP
  networks is defined (0.0.0.0). To create a subnet, simply provide a name and
  description (these are also seen elsewhere in Auditor reports, so it is
  worthwhile using meaningful names) and a subnet address together with the
  subnet mask.</p>

<p>Subnets other than the default subnet can be
  deleted as required.</p>
<h2>Subnet filters</h2>
<p>Subnet Filters allow you to define objects (which
  comprise one or more previously defined subnets) that can be used elsewhere in
  auditor. eg a subnet filter called phones to manage IP phones which would be
  meaningless in a part of the network where there are no ip phones Once the
  desired subnet(s) are defined, a filter
  can be created. This is a matter of inputting a name and selection (or
  multi-selecting with "control" clicking the subnets) and then clicking "Add new
  subnet filter".</p>
