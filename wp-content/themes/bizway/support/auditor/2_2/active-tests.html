<h1><span class="purple">Active Tests</span></h1>
<p >Active test provides the ability to immediately test the
  presence of an IP address and availability of TCP ports on that IP address or
  subnet in real time. With SNMP methods of polling IP addresses, the data can be
  5 minutes or more out of date and typically just provides a record of an IP
  address being present on the network in the past.</p>

<p >Active Test goes further; in that an administrator can pre-define
  a series of tests to verify the availability of a TCP port, and record the
  response time of those tests, clicking the relevant disc initiates the test.</p>

      Active Test is only initiated by the operator via the web browser
        session. Active test is activated only from IP forensics in a subnet with
        Active tests configured, or commanded via the "Active Test All" button when
        displaying a list of IP addresses in a search result.</p></td>

<p >Active Test works by sending a SYN to the target IP address
  and port. If the port connection is made, Rebasoft Auditor closes the session
  and records the response time. If the IP/port does not respond, only the single
  packet is sent and no retransmission occurs. This way, the network overhead is
  negligible.</p>
  
  <p><img src="2_2/images/test-now.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="2" align="left" /> provides a method for ad hoc testing, simply enter the port no. to be tested and click the arrow, the
  result will show below the input box, hover over the disc to see the response
  time.</p><br />
<p >Active Test provides 2 key benefits:</p>
<ol><li>In the absence of any other tools, active test
  verifies the instant status of a remote IP address, avoiding the need to deploy
  cable test for initial diagnosis. This speeds up the process of problem
  solving. The port test can also verify the correct services are showing as
  available - a possible indication of correct functioning of the remote device.</li>
  <li>Active test can also test if a port is available, so it can be used as a security tool to identify end
  device ports that should not be available - a possible indication of
  miss-configuration, presence of malware or even presence of a rogue device.</p>
