  <h1><span class="purple">Application structure</span></h1>
  <p>Rebasoft Auditor has been designed with ease of use in mind. Information  is displayed both graphically and in table form depending on user requirements.  The reports view shows summary level in graphical form at the Network, Site and  Device levels, providing an easily assimilated view of Interfaces and MAC  addresses.</p>
  <p>    The Operations view allows a workflow drill down from Site to Device to details  via VLAN, Interfaces or MACs. Alternatively users can take advantage of the  powerful search function.</p>
  <p>    The screen shot  below shows the main areas for interacting with Rebasoft Auditor:</p>
  <center><img src="2_2/images/image021.jpg" width="550" /></center>
<p>The <strong>Searches</strong> input allows  searching across the entire Auditor database on any string. See Searches for  more information on searching.</p>
<p>  The <strong>Admin selector </strong>isonly shown to &ldquo;admin&rdquo; class users and  provides the navigation to the Admin &amp; configuration functions in Rebasoft  Auditor.</p>
<p>  The <strong>Sites and  Device selector</strong> lists  the sites tree structure and devices contained within site. The VLANs,  interfaces and MAC&rsquo;s seen on each device can be directly accessed from the tree  view. See Sites&nbsp;administration for more details in setting up and  administering sites. </p>
<p>  Information selected in the sites and devices  frame is then displayed in the <strong>Display  frame</strong>.</p>
<p>  Finally, the <strong>Events frame</strong> displays system information, including license status and utilisation and a  link to system event alerts.</p>

    the mouse on the desired column heading. The first click will sort from low to

  <p>To aid comprehension, lists are paginated. To navigate
  around a list, the table modifier is displayed at the foot of the table:</p>
        <center><img src="2_2/images/image023.jpg"  /></center>
<p>By default, 10 list items are displayed, but this can be
  increased by changing the "Show:" value from the dropdown.</p>
<br /><br />

  <ul>
  <li>The first page of the list can be displayed by clicking: <img src="2_2/images/image024.png"  /></li>
  <li>The last page of the list can be displayed by clicking: <img src="2_2/images/image025.png"  /></li>
  <li>The previous page of the list can be displayed by clicking: <img src="2_2/images/image026.png"  /></li>
  <li>The next page of the list can be displayed by clicking: <img src="2_2/images/image027.png"  /></li>
  </ul>
  <p>CSV exporting of data is available from paginated reports, single pages can be exported (by selecting the relevant page and clicking on the CSV button), alternatively the option Show: ALL can be selected before the CSV button is clicked to export the complete report.</p>
  <h4>Navigating reports</h4>
  <p>From each of the graphical reports, it is possible to "zoom" the time frame in and out by selecting in the

      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
            When zooming
              on Dashboard, Site or Device overview on one selected report, Rebasoft Auditor

           <center><img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image011.jpg" width="400"/></center>

  <p>In addition to zooming, it
  is possible to select reports for the selected site and timeframe.</p>
  <h4>Timeline manipulation</h4>
  <p>In the User, IP, MAC and VLAN forensics reports, Rebasoft Auditor
    displays timelines for easy visual assimilation of information. It is possible
    from these time lines to move back and forward along the time line at a

  <ul>
  <li>To move back along time at the current resolution click <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image013.gif" /></li>
  <li>To move forward along the timeline click the right arrow <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image014.gif" /></li>
  <li>To Zoom out (to view more data on the time line) click <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image015.gif" /></li>
  <li>To Zoom in for more detailed data on the time line click <img src="../img/Usermanual_2_0/image016.gif" />

 </ul>
 <p>It is also possible

    information on screen, it is also possible to arrange timelines and details to
  suit user requirements in lining up IP and MAC over time.</p>
