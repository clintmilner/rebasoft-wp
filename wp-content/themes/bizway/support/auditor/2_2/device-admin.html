<h1><span class="purple">Devices administration</span></h1>
<p>Any device that has a CAM table can be a data source for Rebasoft Auditor - this might be Layer 3 switch, Router or Firewall. Any database table (static or dynamic) can be an additional source for Rebasoft Auditor but the CAM table is the basic requirement to be able to relate the MAC address to the other dynamic data collected from the network. Rebasoft Auditor uses SNMP to poll device MIB parameters using RFC standards to retrieve the required information from the device. Where a device is not compliant, it is possible to use a custom MIB - Rebasoft will consider adding vendor MIBs to Rebasoft Auditor to support customer requirements. We have also provided an over-ride to cater to devices where the MIB definitions present inconsistent results.</p>
<p>To add, delete or manage existing devices, administrators should select "Devices" from the administration dropdown & click the arrow:

<h2>Add a device</h2>
<p>Devices can be added either directly from their IP address or from their assigned DNS name. Administrators can add up to 10 devices via the add device button. To add more than 10 devices, it is advisable to use the bulk loading dialog. </p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
    To add a device (or devices) directly to a site, simply select from the site dropdown. If the site selector is "none", the device will be added to the "All devices" site only. </p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br /><br />
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image101.png" width="300" /></center>

<p>To add multiple devices, simply separate with a comma; for example  &ldquo;router1, switch1, firewall8&rdquo; will add 3 devices &ndash; DNS will resolve the device  to the current IP address. Up to 10 devices may be added using this method  using IP addresses. </p>
<p>To add a range of devices, simply add the start of the range and the end  of the range separated with a space; for example &ldquo;1.1.1.1 1.1.1.50&rdquo; will add and  scan fifty devices from 1.1.1.1 to 1.1.1.50. </p>
<p>For multiple ranges, it is recommended that the bulk load facility is  used</p>
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image102.png" width="550" /></center>

<p>Devices can be bulk loaded by cutting and pasting lines into the Bulk
  load dialog. The format of the load is shown below:</p>
<code>&lt;ipaddress&gt;:&lt;snmpCommunity&gt;:&lt;SiteName&gt;</code>
<p>This loads a single IP address per line. If
  snmpCommunity is omitted, Rebasoft Auditor uses the system defaults in turn to
  contact the device. If SiteName is omitted, device is added to "All devices".
  The colon ( : ) is a field delimiter. If the site does not currently exist, it
  will be created dynamically</p>
<code>&lt;ipaddress_start&gt;
  &lt;ipaddress_end&gt;:snmpCommunity:SiteName</code>
<p>In this case the space between the 2 IP
  addresses indicates that Rebasoft Auditor should add the range of addresses
  between the two. The same provisions apply for snmpCommunity &amp; SiteName</p>
<code>&lt;ipaddress_1&gt;,&lt;ipaddress_2&gt;,&lt;ipaddress_3&gt;:&lt;snmpCommunity&gt;:&lt;SiteName&gt;</code>
<p>A set of IP addresses separated by commas constitutes a list to be processed.</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
      If more than 90 devices are loaded at a time, then the list of devices can be up loaded in a
  file, the same format rules apply as in single device</p></td>
  </tr>

<h2>Changing device settings</h2>
<p>Once a device has been added to the Rebasoft Auditor database, certain
  settings can be overridden or adjusted.</p>    
  <center><img src="2_2/images/image103.png" width="550" /></center>

<p>The list of devices in the Auditor database is shown, a filter is
  provided to narrow down the list if a large number of devices is present.</p>
<p>To select a device to view or edit, simply highlight it from the list. A
  summary of the device is show, and options, as below, are available for view or
  override.</p>
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image104.png" width="500" /></center>

<p>It is possible to enable or disable a device, simply tick the enable
  box, and then click the "<b>Save device"</b> button. Failure to click the save device button will cause changes to be lost
  if navigating away from the page:</p>
<p><b>"Rescan"</b> will cause the device to be polled using
  SNMP.</p>
<p><b>"Save device"</b> will cause the device updated information
  to be to be saved to the database. Navigation away from this page without
  saving changes causes them to be lost.</p>
<p><b>"Remove device"</b> deletes the device from Rebasoft Auditor,
  but does not delete the device data collected in the current month. Removing a
  device will stop it being polled for information. A removed device / interface
  will not count towards the license count, but will still appear in the
  sites/devices list.</p>
<p><b>"Remove device and data"</b> removes all device and information
  collected via that device from the Rebasoft Auditor system for the current
  month. Any data collected via a different device will still remain in the
  database. Hence MAC, IP and UserID data will still remain in the system if it
  has been collected via another device.</p>
<p><b>"Test device"</b> sends an SNMP get command immediately to
  the device - this helps when troubleshooting SNMP issues while adding devices - where for example a firewall port might need to be opened (port 161) to enable
  successful SNMP polling</p>
<p><b>"Reset interfaces"</b> reverts any manual changes back to those
  collected via SNMP from the target device</p>
<p><b>"Test bridge table"</b> returns the output from the CAM/Bridge
  table on the target device - thus providing a direct cross check that Auditor
  is returning information from the target device.</p>
<p>It is also possible to override standard interface names and add
  descriptions to aid users:</p>
      <center><img src="2_2/images/image105.jpg" width="550" /></center>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the interface
  index, or retrieved parameter does not match the desired display,
  administrators can override the "ifindex", name and description displayed. </p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
      The
        labels in the reports will be marked with * to differentiate the interface
        from polled information.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Use of this
  facility should be carefully considered as reports against interfaces may not
  be accurately shown.</p>
