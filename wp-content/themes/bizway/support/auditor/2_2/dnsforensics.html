<h1><span class="purple">Hostname (DNS) forensics</span></h1>
<p>Auditor has the ability to report on the hostname history for any IP  address indexed by Auditor. Each IP address indexed by Auditor is added to a  collection list and Auditor attempts to resolve the hostname via DNS. If a DNS  entry is found, Auditor records this entry in its database. Administrators can  control (via the System settings administration ) the frequency of DNS lookup, retention  period and concurrent lookups via the Database  Settings . When a DNS lookup successfully returns a  hostname, the data is stored in Auditors database.</p>
