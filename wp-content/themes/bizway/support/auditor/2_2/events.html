  <p>Rebasoft Auditor can generate alerts and notify users via the web console and, optionally, one or more syslog servers.</p>
  <p>Events are accessed via the link on the home page beneath Sites and devices:</p>

  <p>Events are classified by type (System, User, Watchlist,  Whitelist and device):</p>
  
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image053.jpg" width="400" /></center>
  <p>Clicking any of the hyperlinks will filter the event list to display the relevant information.</p>
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image054.jpg" width="400" /></center>
  <p>Events can be deleted, acknowledged or un-acknowledged. These actions do not affect any events that have already been forwarded to any external syslog received configured in <a href="help.php?version=2.2&system-settings#syslog">System Alerts</a> settings.</p>
