<h1><span class="purple">IP Forensics</span></h1>
  <p>From any screen it is possible to drill into IP forensics (by clicking  on the underlined IP Address), where details on DNS, UserID, ARP and interfaces  are shown for the IP address.</p>

  <p>RebaSoft Auditor has the ability not only to display DNS,  but to cache and search on it in the database. IP information can be located  now via MAC, User and DNS. </p>
  <p> If integrated with a monitoring program such as NetFlow  Tracker, the IP Forensics screen can show a native presentation of the integrated  application (see Advanced Integration). </p>
  <p> Where possible, Rebasoft Auditor will show last seen MAC to  IP association. If the ARP information for the Last Seen MAC is not collected  by the system, Rebasoft Auditor cannot display this information.</p>
  <p> Below the Last Seen entry, Rebasoft Auditor will show if  there is any user association with the IP address, and show, over time, which  users have been associated with the IP address. The User or green bar can be  clicked to navigate to User forensics  (which will show which IP addresses the user has been associated with and their  last seen connection).</p>
  <p>ARP Entries shows the ARP information for IP relation to MAC  address, and where that MAC address has been seen over time.</p>

  <p>On IP forensics and IP address lists, Active Tests,  if configured for the IP range selected, are executed, and the results  displayed. See Active Tests  for a detailed description on how this operates.</p>
<p>On any of the timelines forensic details of exact timings  can be obtained by clicking the details &ldquo;+&rdquo; button. Insert image</p>
