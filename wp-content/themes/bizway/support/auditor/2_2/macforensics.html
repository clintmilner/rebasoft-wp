<p>Rebasoft Auditor shows the MAC address, and from the Vendor lookup  facility, the Vendor or Manufacturer that has the IP Address assigned. Below  the MAC address is Action, clicking on the &lsquo;Add Watch Entry&rsquo; adds the MAC  address to the watch list (see Watch List) so an alert is given whenever it is  seen on the network, to assist with the handling of the alert a reason (stolen  PC, previous virus source, unauthorised access point) can be attached. </p>
<p>If there is an ARP entry on a device for the MAC address, Rebasoft  Auditor will show the IP address allocation history of the MAC address. The IP  details shows the no. of IP addresses assigned to the  MAC address and the IP Address History shows a timeline of  IP address assignment. Where the time bar appears solid further granularity can be gained by  clicking on &lsquo;details &ldquo;+&rdquo;&rsquo; which will show the breakdown of when the IP was active on the network and what IP address was  assigned at the time. The Connection history shows the connections over time.  This is available in graphical timeline view or tabular view if details are  selected.</p>

<p>Connections show the devices, VLAN and interfaces that the MAC address  has been seen on (The MAC Count shows the total number of unique  MAC&rsquo;s also seen on that interface). </p>
