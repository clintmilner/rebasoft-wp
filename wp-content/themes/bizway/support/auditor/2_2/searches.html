<h1><span class="purple">Searches</span></h1>
  <p>Rebasoft Auditor&rsquo;s powerful search engine allows users to search for  items in the database. Most users will use the search as way to quickly  navigate to the point of interest. Searching can match on full or partial  strings entered in the search box</p>
  <p>Search accuracy can be  improved by specifying a more complete string. For example, searching on &ldquo;10.100.1&rdquo;  will bring up all the matching records containing this string &ndash; in this case  matching IP addresses and devices.</p>
<p>Searches return  results for MAC, User ID, IP address, Hostnames, Device details, Interfaces and  VLANS: </p>

<td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Tip:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
          If you click
              the search button without entering any parameters, Rebasoft Auditor returns a
              search of all entries in the database.</p></td>
        </tr>

<p>Only when you select a search result does Rebasoft Auditor  query the database (default 8 days) to see when the item occurred. Information  displayed in timelines allows users to view longer or short periods of time as  required. Using this method Auditor, for example, does require users to know  when someone was on the network to see if they've ever logged in.</p>

           You can search for multiple IP addresses by entering a comma between desired IP's</p></td>

  <p>Searching
    can be improved by specifying a string or partial string match to be searched
    on. For example, searching on "10.100.1" will bring up all the matching
  records with the string - in this case matching IP addresses and devices.</p>
  <p>Searching the database in
    this way would allow help desk staff to quickly identify a user from Active
    directory, to IP address to MAC to physical location and network port. Active
  test can then verify the status of the device.</p>
