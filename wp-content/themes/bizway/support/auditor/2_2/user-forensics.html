<h1><span class="purple">User forensics</span></h1>
  <p>User forensics can be used to find the IP and hence the MAC history of a  UserID. Accessed by clicking on the UserID (when it is underlined) or by  searching on a required UserID, In addition to the UserID, Domain and first  &amp; last times they were seen on the network, User forensics will show the  last seen connection for the user &ndash; relating UserID, to IP address, to MAC  Address to Device and interface. Device and Interface details will only be  shown if Rebasoft Auditor is collecting information from the device that the  user is connected to. </p>

  <p>User forensics will be populated only if has been correctly configured,  and Rebasoft Auditor has had sufficient time to start collecting user data from  LDAP or security event log sources.&nbsp; </p>
