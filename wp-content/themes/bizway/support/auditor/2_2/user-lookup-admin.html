  <p>A powerful feature of Rebasoft Auditor is the association of user login  information. This allows organisations to search on UserID as well as IP  address and MAC. The association of this information makes it easy to find  users on the network for help desk and audit purposes.</p>
<center><img src="2_2/images/image112.png" width="500" /></center>
  <p>Rebasoft Auditor supports user lookup via LDAP systems, such as Novell  eDirectory, and Windows 2003 &amp; 2008 Active Directory. Since Active  Directory does not store user login requests in the directory; rather Microsoft  records user logon/logoff information in the system security log, the log must  be accessible to the user configured in the User lookup settings.
  <p>    User details are fully searchable once stored in the database. Please  note that Rebasoft Auditor polls the directory service configured once per  hour, and looks for login records. Hence it may be some time before UserID  information appears in the system.
<p> To access user lookup, select  from the Admin menu:       
<center><img src="2_2/images/image113.png"  /></center>
  <p>The TAG used in setting up LDAP and Active  Directory look up is a label used in reporting. If you have multiple LDAP or  PDC/BDC servers, you could tag them with one or more names. For example you  have an internal domain of &quot;abccompany.local&quot;, but use multiple  authentication servers on your network, using &quot;abccompany.local&quot; as a  tag for each server being polled will allow Rebasoft Auditor to group all user  entries for that group of DC's into a single report</p>
<h2><a id="ldap"></a>User lookup with LDAP</h2>
  <p>Rebasoft Auditor supports user lookup via LDAP. To add LDAP lookup,  administrators should complete the LDAP form below, providing credentials and  LDAP parameters. </p>

  <h2><a id="ad"></a>User lookup with Active Directory</h2>
  <p>User lookup for Active Directory login information is available for both  Windows 2003 and 2008 platforms. Windows authentication lookup allows you to  specify a UTC offset for the logs. This is due to the fact that Windows stores  the timestamp in UTC, and an offset may need to be manually set in order for  the correct time period to be collected (this being due to the Auditor clock  being local server time).</p>
<center><img src="2_2/images/image115.png" width="400"/></center>

<p>To add a lookup, simply specify a tag &ndash; this identifies which server Rebasoft  Auditor has used for the look-up. Specify the server address, domain name and  user ID &amp; password. If a polling period different from 10 minutes is  required, this can be overridden. It is not recommended to change the  UserExcludeFilter.</p>

  <p>Some companies do not like Rebasoft Auditor polling their  domain Controllers directly to collect the UserID to IP address information, to  satisfy these customers Rebasoft provide a Microsoft Visual Basic Script which  will poll the relevant logs on the server and post the information via a  standard XML over the http call to the Auditor server. The script  (raPostUsersXXXX.vbs, where xxxx is the version) is located in the  Auditor\resources\scripts\UserCollection\ directory, this script should be  copied to the server(s) doing the polling of the event log (this could be the  DC itself or another server that has access to the DC).&nbsp; The script can be edited with Microsoft  Notepad and has a number of parameters that should be changed depending on the  environment.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
<code class="prettyprint">
AuditorUserName = &quot;admin&quot;<br />
AuditorUserPass = &quot;admin&quot;<br />
AuditorServerURL = &quot;<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8082/">http://127.0.0.1:8082/</a>&quot;<br />
serverUserFilter = &quot;.\$|ANONYMOUS LOGON|SYSTEM|LOCAL  SERVICE&quot;<br /><br />
  
  serverVersion&nbsp; =  &quot;2008&quot;<br />
    serverIP = &quot;172.21.40.1&quot;<br />
    serverDomain = &quot;&quot;<br />
    serverUser = &quot;administrator&quot;<br />
    serverPassword = &quot;adminpassword&quot;<br />
    serverPollPeriod&nbsp; =  &quot;10&quot;</code>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The settings starting with AuditorXXXX relate to the  server running the Rebasoft Auditor application.<br />
    The settings starting with serverXXXX relate to the  Domain Controller being polled for information.</p>
