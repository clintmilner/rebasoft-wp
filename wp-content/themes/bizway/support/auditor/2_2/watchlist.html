<h1><span class="purple">Watch list</span></h1>
  <p>Rebasoft Auditor is able to  help track devices on the network. Whether users require alerts about a rogue  access point, or a stolen Laptop, as soon as it is seen on the network, a Watch  list alert is displayed and a syslog alert is optionally generated. Clicking on  the hyperlink shows a list of watched devices and when seen on the network: </p>
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image055.jpg" width="500" /></center>

  <p>Users can click manage the alert  or click on the MAC address link to see further details on the device and why  it is on the watch list. </p>
  <p>Watch lists can be added via 2  methods.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>From the MAC forensics screen by clicking the &ldquo;Add Watch entry&rdquo; link:<br /><br />
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image056.png" width="500" /></center></li>

 <li>Or via the Watch list
  admin drop down: <br /><br />
    <center><img src="2_2/images/image057.png" /></center></li>
</li></ol>
  <br /><br />
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">Only administrators can add a watch entry
</p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
  <p>Watch lists are configured in the following screen:</p>
<center><img src="2_2/images/image058.jpg" width="500"/></center><br /><br />
 <ol>
      <li>Add  device (plus a description) to the watch list.</li>
      <li>Once  the watch list device is added, decide on a syslog alerter setting if required.</li>
      <li>Alerts  for watch lists can be multiple and can be deleted without the Watch list entry  being deleted.</li>
</ol>
    <p>Alerts are only sent when a MAC address is first  seen by Rebasoft Auditor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
        Restarting Rebasoft Auditor
          does not cause generation of new alerts as the system retains Watchlist
      status information in the database.</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p >If a previously seen MAC
    address leaves the network (for the CAM hold down period) and Rebasoft Auditor is
    then restarted you will, of course, generate an alert as this would be classed
    as a new Watchlist hit.
</p>
  <p >The syslog message will be
  sent as:<BR /><BR />
  <code class="prettyprint">messages.2:Sep&nbsp; 1 17:32:42 172.21.40.199 Rebasoft Auditor Watch Entry Seen:<br />00:1f:c5:ed:ae:23 on

  <p >The MAC Forensics screen shows the first and last  times this device was seen on the network and also alerts users as to whether  the particular device is being watched. </p>
