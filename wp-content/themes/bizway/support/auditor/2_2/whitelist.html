<h1><span class="purple">White list</span></h1>
<p>While list is selectable by  site, and is a facility to generate alerts on new devices accessing the network  at that site. For example if you have a locked down standard build for a remote  location, you can use Rebasoft Auditor to alert on any device not previously  seen connecting to the network at that site. White list alerts are reported to  the Site overview screen, the events system and, optionally, a syslog receiver.</p>

<p>White list settings provide the ability to start, stop and reset White list monitoring. If a configured site has one or more devices being polled by MAC Auditor, monitoring can be activated by clicking the "Monitor" button.</p>

<p>If an asset system already records the MAC address of devices, these can be manually added to MAC Auditor via the "Add" button.</p>
