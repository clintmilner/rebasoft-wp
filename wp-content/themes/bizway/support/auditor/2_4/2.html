<h1><a name="_Toc310518000" id="_Toc310518000"><b>Capacity view</b></a></h1>
<p>Auditor, as it collects data
        from your network over time, enables administrators to track interface
        usage over time. The reporting can be done at system, site and device
        level; capacity Reporting will adjust the output relevant to your area
        of interest accommodating networks large and small.</p>
<p>Auditor not only tracks interface
        status, but also records MAC, IP and users attached to the interface.
        Thus a real-time, up-to-date view on real interface availability can
        be shown.</p>
<p>Capacity view, therefore, provides
        two key functions:</p>
<li>1)&nbsp; The
  ability to report, over time, on asset utilization across the network</p>
<li>2)&nbsp; generate
  change plans from real-time, dynamic data; the change plans can be compared
  against actual connections showing any variation from the plan.</p>
<p>The reports generated by Auditor
        can be exported to pdf, csv, xml and more.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc310518007" id="_Toc310518007"><b>Tagging</b></a></h1>
<p>To a non-technical user, a network
        can be a difficult thing to decipher and understand. Auditor can help
        with this via the ability to "Tag" an item with additional information.
        This information may be something as simple as the ability for a note
        to be manually entered – for example a MAC Address with "Mike’s desktop
        pc" - through to the same MAC address being associated with data imported
        or updated from an asset management system. With the right information,
        It is possible to answer a question like "how many dell pc’s running
        Windows XP service pack 3 do I have on my network?"</p>
<p>Administrators can set any number
        of "extra dimensions" available for tagging. There are two methods of
        tagging within Auditor :</p>
<li>1.&nbsp; Manually
  – set via the Tagging administration dialog</p>
<li>2.&nbsp; CSV
  import from, for example,  excel spread sheet, also set via Tagging administration</p>
<p>As soon as a tag has been stored
        in Auditor  it is searchable and available for reporting. In the same
        way tags can also be deleted (permanently) from the database. As tagged
        information is available from external sources, Auditor  also has a way
        to make that information permanent or transient depending on how the
        data is imported.</p>
<p>Tagging is accessed via the
        Admin dropdown:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="130" height="206"
src="images/image168.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_26" /></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc310518008" id="_Toc310518008"><b><i>Manual
              tag building and data entry</i></b></a></h2>
<p>Manual tagging allows administrators
        to add a category to data types within Auditor . The tagging administration
        screen allows administrators to add tag categories that can be used within
        the application. </p>
<p>From V2.4, Auditor allows administrators
        to define a tag and:</p>
<li>1)&nbsp; State
  whether the values in the tag are unique (so within an element you could have
  a department with either a single allowable entry, or multiple entries)</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Set
  an expiry lifetime for the tag</p>
<li>3)&nbsp; Set
  a url and pass the tag contents as part of the url. In the example below, Auditor
  is passing the phone extension number to a VoIP monitoring module.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="510" height="132"
src="images/image170.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_25" /></p>
<p>So for instance, you might want
        to record the "Operating system for a MAC Address (Say "Windows 7").  To
        build this, you simply key the desired name into the field next to the
        tag type and hit the green "plus" button.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="244" height="139"
src="images/image172.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_19" /></p>
<p>The moment the tag category
        is added, it is available for use by users:</p>
<p>To add information via Auditor,
        simply click the "plus" button – in this case to add OS details to this
        Dell MAC Address:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="627" height="130"
src="images/image174.png"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_117" /></p>
<p>If there is more than one category,
        simply select from the drop-down, key in the information and click "add"</p>
<p><img border="0" width="282" height="122"
src="images/image176.png"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_115" /></p>
<p>Once the information is added,
        it is available for search. Information can be deleted by "moussing"
        over the tag, and clicking the small red cross to delete:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="216" height="73"
src="images/image178.png"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_116" /></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc310518009" id="_Toc310518009"><b><i>CSV
              import</i></b></a></h2>
<p>Clearly manual tagging has somewhat
        limited scope, especially when there are thousands of devices, users
        and IP’s connected to the network.</p>
<p>In the case where larger quantities
        of data need to be added, an import method is needed. If data is available
        in "csv" format, the information can be imported into Auditor tags:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="303" height="131"
src="images/image180.png"
v:shapes="_x0000_i1090" /></p>
<p>Simply browse to the spread
        sheet (in csv format) and upload to Auditor. Once successfully uploaded,
        administrators can click on the filename and complete the import process.</p>
<p>The workflow confirms:</p>
<li>1.&nbsp; the
  file-type; CSV (Commas Separated Values) or TSV (Tab Separated Values), </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; whether
  you wish to include the header line as a value or not.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; (After
  pressing the Test button, the data is displayed)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Simply
  select the Tag type – where you want the data displayed</p>
<li>5.&nbsp; Enter
  the category name, and which columns represent the item reference column and
  the Value column – this case, what is the MAC address we wish to associate
  the data with, and the data column we wish to insert.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="553" height="273"
src="images/image182.png"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_11" /></p>
<p>A future version of Auditor  will
        include the ability to use XML to reference external applications (such
        as HR or an Asset management system) as the source to replicate the data
        from.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc310518010" id="_Toc310518010"></a><a name="_Ref258345622" id="_Ref258345622"></a><a
name="_Toc241663439" id="_Toc241663439"><b>Integration</b></a></h1>
<p>Auditor is an open application and
      has been designed with powerful integration facilities. Integration differs
      from tagging in that information is only displayed within Auditor not stored
      within the database. Integration can also be both ways; namely using Auditor
      to access information from in an external system, and/or providing mechanisms
      for external systems to access Auditor data/reports</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc310518011" id="_Toc310518011"><b><i>Crafted
              URL</i></b></a></h2>
<p>A productivity mechanism introduced
      in the first version of Auditor is the crafted URL. This allows users to
      quickly display relevant information without needing to learn or login
      to external systems. So, for example, from an IP address, you might click
      to show the NetFlow conversations for that address. This is done from calling
      the desired NetFlow report with the currently displayed IP address within
      Auditor. </p>
<p>Any system that can be accessed via
      a URL, or has a web-start via a URL call can be accessed. The crafted URL
      could be called and passed a one of four main variables:</p>
<p>·&nbsp; REBA_MAC
    – passes the current MAC address to the URL</p>
<p >·&nbsp; REBA_IP
    – passes the current IP address to the URL</p>
<p >·&nbsp; REBA_DEVICE
    – passes the device IP address to URL</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" >·&nbsp; REBA_INTERFACE
    – passes the interface index to the URL</p>
<p>Once called, the application is then
      shown in the display frame. Crafted URL represents the fastest and easiest
      method of integration:</p>
<p>To set-up crafted URL integration
      select integration from the Admin dropdown:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="135" height="216"
src="images/image184.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_164" /></p>
<p>To enable integration, select the
      "Type" required and provide a name (This name will be displayed on the
      appropriate page under tools). Optionally a filter (set in Subnet
      filters) can be set to restrict the integration
      URL; so you may have server tools just available to server subnet/vlans,
      and PC tools to various DNCP scopes:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="531" height="213"
src="images/image186.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_27" /></p>
<p>Integrations can be added or deleted,
      or if the same name is inputted for an existing device, MAC, IP or interface
      integration, overwritten.</p>
<p>Once added, the integration appears as a "tool" at the
        IP, MAC, Device or interface level:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="506" height="168"
src="images/image188.jpg"
alt="Description: integration-tools.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_108" /></p>
<p>While there are no limits to the number or types of
        integrations available, Rebasoft recommend no more than 4 or 5 per level
        be configured to maintain clarity during application use.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc310518012" id="_Toc310518012"><b><i>Auditor
              Crafted URLs</i></b></a></h2>
<p>In order to comply with the design goal of being open,
        all reports and links within Auditor  are accessible via a URL. Hence
        it is possible to call Auditor  from any web application. For example,
        a search with a search parameter can be called via a URL from any web
        application:</p>
<p>http://&lt;server_IP&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/?action=Seach&amp;SearchValue=&lt;any
        argument&gt; </p>
<p>To aid security, and prevent
        users accessing Auditor from a system which they have already authenticated
        to, there is now the ability to embed portal users credentials into the
        url of a link called by the external application. The portal user settings
        are set within User administration by simply adding
        a user name and IP address to the portal users dialog.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="193" height="179"
src="images/image190.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_96" /></p>
<p>The url called must include
        the "portalUser=&lt;User Name&gt;" parameter within the string. Where
        the &lt;user name&gt; is configured as above. Security is also provided
        by the addition of the source IP address from which the portal user is
        called from. </p>
<p>Below is an example of URL access:</p>
<p>Site Overview (passing username
        and password in url)</p>
<p>http://server_address/?action=siteOverview&amp;siteSelection=Cell2&amp;userName=admin&amp;userPass=admin </p>
<p>More examples can be found on-line
        in our Knowledgebase (<a

<h2><a name="_Toc310518013" id="_Toc310518013"><b><i>Direct
              access to Data</i></b></a></h2>
<p>In addition to Crafted URL,
        Auditor has also implemented REST. This way programmatic access to Auditor
        data can be built. The data is returned using JSON, though optionally
        XML can be specified as the output format during the call. The general
        format of REST calls to Auditor is shown below:</p>

<p>Auditor  offers two levels of security – normal user
        or admin user. Admin users have the ability to create and manage sites,
        users, devices and communities. Normal users are just able to view reports
        and information captured by Auditor . This way, administrators could
        grant access to helpdesk staff without granting privileges to change

<h2><a name="_Toc310518017" id="_Toc310518017"><b><i>Subnets</i></b></a></h2>
<p>Subnet administration allows
        you define network segments and apply one or more in filters for use
        in Auditor. One reason this may be desirable is when defining integrations,
        where a particular tool or application to be called is only relevant
        to a set of devices in part of the network.</p>
<p>Subnets are defined from the
        subnets administration dialog:</p>

<p>By default,
          a subnet encompassing all IP networks is defined. To create a subnet,
          simply provide a name and description (these are also seen elsewhere
          in Auditor reports, so it is worthwhile using meaning names) and a
          subnet together with the subnet mask.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="214" height="189"

<p>SNMP settings allow administrators to control Auditor
        SNMP settings. System wide community strings can be set (these can be
        overridden during device discovery) as well as enabling overrides for
        SNMP discovered information. </p>
<p>SNMP Community strings, if entered during device input,
        are used first. In the absence of a specified SNMP community string,
        system level SNMP communities are used in turn until a successful poll
        is performed. Auditor  then stores the successful string with the device,
        this reduces the number of alerts that a device might generate if a community
        is used unsuccessfully.  It is only necessary to use Read-only strings. </p>
<p>To add a new community simply type the string into the
        box &amp; click "Add community"</p>
<p><img border="0" width="305" height="138"
src="images/image211.jpg"

<p>To remove a community, simply
        click the cross next to the string to be removed</p>
<p>Auditor also has two new facilities
        requested by our customers, namely to change device name cases. Administrators
        can select UPPER or lower cases for storage and display; in which case
        following each SNMP poll, Auditor stores the device name in the required
        case. "Do nothing" simply accepts the device name (hostname) as configured
        from the polled device.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="280" height="116"
src="images/image213.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_121" /></p>
<p>Sometimes, for legibility in
        Auditor, it is desirable to remove text from the device name. This may
        be useful if the device (hostname) is a FQDN format (such as cat3750-rm104.abcompany.com),
        you can then remove any desired element (for example ".abcompany.com")
        from the device name. This setting is also persistent even when the device
        is re-polled by SNMP.</p>

v:shapes="Picture_x0020_113" /></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc310518022" id="_Toc310518022"><b>Network Discovery</b></a></h3>
<p>Auditor (V2.2 or later) provides
        the ability to automatically discover network devices using Cisco Discovery
        Protocol (CDP) and/or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). These protocols
        rely upon the network devices to be discovered having CDP or LLDP enabled.
        The configuration guides of the various vendors can advise on how CDP/LLDP
        can be enabled. </p>
<p><img border="0" width="259" height="102"
src="images/image217.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_130" /></p>
<p>CDP and LLDP have two operating
        modes. CDP and LLDP can be used to add devices to Auditors polling list,
        and this collect ARP, CAM and other information from the MIB. In addition
        CDP and LLDP can be used to resolve hostnames, such as the phone ID for
        Cisco IP phones.</p>
<p>Subnet filters can be applied to CDP and LLDP settings to
  limit the bounds of CDP and LLDP discovery, to reduce traffic and prevent devices
  inadvertently being added to Auditor’s device list.</p>

        time-to-time, and any new release of Auditor  will contain the latest

        a vendor entry, it may be that the index is out-of-date. </p>

<p><img border="0" width="274" height="161"

<p>Any device that has a CAM table can be a data source
        for Auditor  – this might be Layer 3 switch, Router or Firewall. Auditor  uses
        SNMP to poll device MIB parameters using RFC standards to retrieve the
        required information from the device. Where a device is not compliant,
        it is possible to use a custom MIB – Rebasoft will consider adding vendor
        MIBs to Auditor  to support customer requirements. We have also provided
        an over-ride to cater to devices where the MIB definitions present inconsistent
        results.</p>
<p>To add, delete or manage existing devices, administrators
        should select "Devices" from the administration dropdown &amp; click

        resolve the device to the current IP address. Up to 10 devices may be
        added using this method using IP addresses. </p>
<p>To add a range of devices, simply add the start of the
        range and the end of the range separated with a space; for example "1.1.1.1
        1.1.1.50" will add and scan fifty devices from 1.1.1.1 to 1.1.1.50. </p>
<p>For multiple ranges, it is recommended that the bulk

<p>In
        this case the space between the 2 IP addresses indicates that Auditor  should

<p>The list of devices in the Auditor database is shown,
        a filter is provided to narrow down the list if a large number of devices
        are present.</p>
<p>To select a device to view or edit, simply highlight
        it from the list. A summary of the device is show, and options, as below,
        are available for view or override.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="403" height="210"

<p>It is possible to enable or disable a device, simply
        tick the enable box, and then click the "<b>Save
        device"</b> button. Failure to click the save device button will
        cause changes to be lost if navigating away from the page:</p>
<p><b>"Rescan"</b> will cause the device
  to be polled using SNMP.</p>
<p><b>"Save device"</b> will cause the
  device updated information to be to be saved to the database. Navigation away
  from this page without saving changes causes them to be lost.</p>
<p><b>"Remove device"</b> deletes the
  device from Auditor , but does not delete the device data collected in the
  current month. Removing a device will stop it being polled for information.
  A removed device / interface will not count towards the license count, but
  will still appear in the sites/devices list.</p>
<p><b>"Remove device and data"</b> removes
  all device and information collected via that device from the Auditor  system
  for the current month. Any data collected via a different device will still
  remain in the database. Hence MAC, IP and UserID data will still remain in
  the system if it has been collected via another device.</p>
<p><b>"Test device"</b> sends an SNMP
  get command immediately to the device – this helps when troubleshooting SNMP
  issues while adding devices – where for example a firewall port might need
  to be opened (port 161) to enable successful SNMP polling</p>
<p><b>"Reset interfaces"</b> reverts
  any manual changes back to those collected via SNMP from the target device</p>
<p><b>"Test bridge table"</b> returns
  the output from the CAM/Bridge table on the target device – thus providing
  a direct cross check that Auditor is returning information from the target
  device.</p>
<p>It is also possible to override standard interface names
        and add descriptions to aid users:</p>

alt="Description: devices-admin-edit-details.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_145" /></p>
<p>If the interface index, or
        retrieved parameter does not match the desired display, administrators
        can override the "ifindex", name and description displayed. </p>

<p>Auditor  provides administrators the
      ability to model their real-world network with Sites. A Site is simply
      a container that can comprise devices and/or other sites (child sites).
      The network can therefore be related to physical or logical locations with,
      for example, locations being divided into sub-locations that contain devices.
      A site can contain both devices and sub-sites.</p>
<p>Consider the example below:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="378" height="274"
src="images/image250.jpg"
alt="Description: usa-visual.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_147" /></p>
<p>In this case, the administrator has
      defined USA as a top level (or parent) site and New York and San Francisco
      as sub (or child) sites. New York and San Francisco could themselves contain
      child sites and/or devices.</p>
<p><img width="576" height="97"
src="images/image251.png"
alt="Text Box: Note:
A site can also be assigned a Visual. A Visual is an image file that is displayed when the site is selected. Visuals are uploaded and assigned when the site is selected.
"
v:shapes="Text_x0020_Box_x0020_66" /></p>
<p>To access Sites administration, select
      "Sites" from the administration dropdown in the top frame and click the
      arrow:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="129" height="207"

src="images/image255.jpg"
alt="Description: sites-admin-new.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_148" /></p>
<p>Once a site has been added it will appear in the Existing
      sites list. Administrators can add or remove a device by using the cursor
      to select a device and add or remove it from the members list. </p>
<p><img border="0" width="461" height="343"

<p>To remove a site, simply highlight
      the site &amp; click the "Remove site button". Removing a site does not
      remove the device or data for that device. The device will remain in any
      other site it is a member of, or will appear in "Unallocated devices" </p>
<p>To rename a site, simply highlight
      the site, type in the new name and click the "Rename Site" button.</p>

<p>In the same way a device can be a
        member of more than one site, so a site may be a child of one or more
        parent sites.</p>
<p>In the display frame, as sites are
        selected, the configured visual is shown. Child sites or devices can

<p>A powerful feature of Auditor  is the associating of
        user login information. This allows organisations to search on UserID
        as well as IP address and MAC. The association of this information makes
        it easy to find users on the network for help desk and audit purposes.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="434" height="291"
src="images/image262.jpg"
alt="Description: user-lookup-summary.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_155" /></p>
<p>Auditor  supports user lookup via LDAP systems, such
        as Novell eDirectory, and Windows 2003 &amp; 2008 Active Directory. Since
        Active Directory does not store user login requests in the directory;
        rather Microsoft records user logon/logoff information in the system
        security log, the log must be accessible to the user configured in the
        User lookup settings. </p>
<p>User details are fully searchable once stored in the
        database. Please note that Auditor  polls the directory service configured
        once per hour, and looks for login records. Hence it may be some time
        before UserID information appears in the system.</p>
<p>To access user lookup, select from the Admin menu:</p>
<p><img border="0" width="135" height="215"

<p>The TAG used in setting up LDAP and Active Directory
        look up is a label used in reporting. If you have multiple LDAP or PDC/BDC
        servers, you could tag them with one or more names. For example you have
        an internal domain of &quot;abccompany.local&quot;, but use multiple
        authentication servers on your network, using
  &quot;abccompany.local&quot; as a tag for each server being polled will allow
  Auditor  to group all user entries for that group of DC's into a single report.</p>

<p>User lookup for Active Directory login information is
        available for both Windows 2003 and 2008 platforms. Windows authentication
        lookup allows you to specify a UTC offset for the logs. This is dues
        to the fact that Windows stores the timestamp in UTC, and an offset may
        need to be manually set in order for the correct time period to be collected
        (this being due to the Auditor clock being local server time).</p>
<p><img border="0" width="421" height="412"

<p>To add a lookup, simply specify a tag – this identifies
        which server Auditor  has used for the look-up. Specify the server address,
        domain name and user ID &amp; password. If a polling period different
        from 10 minutes is required, this can be overridden. It is not recommended

<p>Active test provides the ability
        to immediately test the presence of an IP address and availability of
        TCP ports on that IP address or subnet in real time. With SNMP methods
        of polling IP addresses, the data can be 5 minutes or more out of date
        and typically just provides a record of an IP address being present on
        the network in the past.</p>
<p><img border="0" width="371" height="168"
src="images/image278.jpg"
alt="Description: active-test.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_156" /></p>
<p>Active Test goes further; in
        that an administrator can define a series of tests to verify the availability
        of a TCP port, and the response time of those tests.</p>
<p><img width="586" height="100"
src="images/image279.png"
 /></p>
<p>Active Test works by sending
        a SYN to the target IP address and port. If the port connection is made,
        Auditor  closes the session and records the response time. If the IP/port
        does not respond, only the single packet is sent and no retransmission
        occurs. This way, the network overhead is negligible.</p>
<p>Active Test provides 2 key benefits:</p>
<li>1)&nbsp; In
  the absence of any other tools, active test verifies the instant status of
  a remote IP address, avoiding the need to deploy cable test for initial diagnosis.
  This speeds up the process of problem solving. The port test can also verify
  the correct services are showing as available – a possible indication of correct
  functioning of the remote device.</p>
<li>2)&nbsp; Active
  test can also verify which ports at the end device are available. Active Test
  can therefore be a security tool to identify end device ports that should not
  be available – a possible indication of miss-configuration, presence of malware
  or even presence of a rogue device.</p>
