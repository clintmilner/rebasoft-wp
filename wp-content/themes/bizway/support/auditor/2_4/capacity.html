<h1>Capacity view</h1>
<p>Auditor, as it collects data
        from your network over time, enables administrators to track interface
        usage over time. The reporting can be done at system, site and device
        level; capacity Reporting will adjust the output relevant to your area
        of interest accommodating networks large and small.</p>
<p>Auditor not only tracks interface
        status, but also records MAC, IP and users attached to the interface.
        Thus a real-time, up-to-date view on real interface availability can
        be shown.</p>
<p>Capacity view, therefore, provides
        two key functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The
  ability to report, over time, on asset utilization across the network</li>
<li>generate
  change plans from real-time, dynamic data; the change plans can be compared
  against actual connections showing any variation from the plan.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reports generated by Auditor
        can be exported to pdf, csv, xml and more.</p>
<h2>Using the Rebasoft Auditor Capacity Module</h2>
<p>Auditor Capacity view is accessible
        via the Capacity option from the view selector in the header section
        of the Web Interface.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="350" src="2_4/images/image136.jpg" /></center>
<p>Once selected, you are presented
        with a System overview comprising information from devices monitored
        by Auditor. This content is dynamic and will change based upon your selected
        view using the Sites &amp; Devices Navigator. </p>
<p>By default, the Capacity view
        will report on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current interface count by status</li>
<li>Historical interface count by status</li>
<li>Current interface count by type and status</li>
<li>Least used devices by interface usage</li>
<li>Top 10 underutilised sites by interface usage</li>
<li>Devices in use (trended count)</li>
<li>Interfaces In Use (Trended count)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Capacity Reporting Menu Bar</h3>
<center><img border="0" width="500" src="2_4/images/image140.jpg" /></center>
<p>Users are able to specify criteria such as output format, report start date and duration of reports for visibility of their required elements.  Output options available areas follows:</p>
<ul><li>HTML</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>XML</li>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>CSV</li></ul>
<p>Clicking on the 'Date' window will produce a date picker, allowing you to specify the start date and reporting period for your report. </p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i>
        <br /><br />Reporting Filters are assigned to the current view that is  selected (such as site or device). If at any time you wish to return to the top  level for Capacity view, select the <img src="2_4/images/image044.png" /> icon next to the  Capacity option from the view selector in the Header section of the Web  Interface.</td>
  </tr>

<p>In addition to the above, the standard navigation buttons are also available throughout the Capacity view.</p>
<h3>Accessing Data within the Overview reports</h3>
<p>Where content is underlined within Auditor, data can be accessed by simply clicking that hyperlink.</p>
<p>To view Interface status reports, select the Legend to the item of interest and the content will change to represent your selection</p>
<h3>Full Interface Status Overview</h3>
<center><img border="0" width="490" src="2_4/images/image144.jpg" /></center>
<p>The Hyperlinks in "Current Interface Count By Type and Status" can be used as a reporting filter. Thus clicking on Oper Status "up" next to Ethernet Admin Up will show the number of Ethernet Up/up interfaces:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="341" src="2_4/images/image146.jpg" /></center>
<p>Clicking on the "Count" next to "oper status" column will list the interfaces comprising the report:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="500" src="2_4/images/image148.jpg" /></center>
<h2>Change Plans</h2>
<p>Capacity view allows users to generate and adjust Change plans. Once finalised Change plans can be compared with actual connections, allowing users to see where there are
variances in the plan and 'close' a plan once completed.</p>
<p>List your Change Plans by selecting a view type on the left navigator ('By User' or 'By Status'). </p>
<center><img border="0" width="111" src="2_4/images/image149.png" /></center>
<h3>Creating a Change Plan</h3>
<p>To create a Change Plan, enter the name of your plan, add any notes required and click the 'Add' button:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="284" src="2_4/images/image151.jpg" /></center>
<p>Once created, your plan will appear in the Change Plan list as a new plan:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="469" src="2_4/images/image153.jpg" /></center>
<p>To add Interfaces an existing 'open' plan, select an interface that you would like to add to the plan and click the 'Add To Plan' button associated with the current listing:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="500" src="2_4/images/image155.jpg" /></center><br /><br />
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i>
        <br /><br />Interfaces can also be added to a change plan from within the operations view at the Interface overview screen. Simply click the add to capacity plan icon:<br /><br /><center><img src="2_4/images/add-to-plan.png" /></center></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Specify the required plan to which you wish to apply the change and choose whether the Interface is  a 'Source' or 'Destination' Interface.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="289" src="2_4/images/image159.jpg" /></center>
<p>Once you have added the Interface to your plan can save the changes by clicking 'Save Plan'. This will update with the current changes.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="500" src="2_4/images/image161.jpg" /></center>
<p>Plans will automatically be set to the following status:</p>
<ol>
<li>New</li>
<li>Source Set or Destination set</li>
<li>Source and destination set</li>
</ol>
<p>To view or amend the plan, click  on the plan name to view the criteria specified for that plan. Interface "To" and "From" mappings can be changed by 'dragging' the ID label up
or down the change list – the cursor changes to a cross.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="308" src="2_4/images/image163.jpg" /></center>
<p>When happy that your Change
        Plan is complete, select Finalise to lock the content of the Change Plan.</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><br /><br />
        Once a change plan has been finalised you CANNOT edit the content of that plan</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>At any point after destination
        interfaces have been set, 'Show Current' will display the current details
        of the "To" interface. If there is a current device this will be shown</p>
<center><img border="0" width="425" height="158"
src="2_4/images/image166.jpg"
v:shapes="Picture_x0020_17" /></center>
<p>"Show current" will allow users
        to see whether an interface is free prior to a change, or check whether
        the "from" and "to" MAC addresses match following a change.</p>
