<h1><span class="purple">Hostname forensics</span></h1>

  <p>Auditor
    has the ability to report on the hostname history for any IP address indexed
    by Auditor. Each IP address indexed by Auditor is added to a collection list
    and Auditor attempts to resolve the hostname via DNS. If a DNS entry is found,
    Auditor records this entry in its database. Administrators can control the
    frequency of DNS lookup, retention period and concurrent lookups via the Database
    Settings.
    When a DNS lookup successfully returns a hostname, the data is stored in
    Auditors database.</p>
