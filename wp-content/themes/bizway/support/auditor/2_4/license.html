<h1><span class="purple">License Administration</span></h1>
  <p>Auditor's
    license is deeply embedded within the application. License information is
    constantly evaluated as devices are polled for SNMP information. The active
    interfaces for a device are updated and added to the total count for all
    devices polled; so from hour to hour and day to day, the number of active
    interfaces will vary.</p>
  <p>When
    the number of active interfaces polled exceeds the licensed number of interfaces,
    the data for interfaces in excess of the license maximum are not stored in
    the database for that polling period. If, subsequently, the total number
    (including the extra ones) falls below the license level, data will once
    again be written to the database). Polling of interfaces from a device happens
    in the order the device presents the data to Auditor, this varies by vendor.
    Devices are polled in sequence, typically every 30 minutes. </p>
  <p>If
    switches or other devices are no longer required the license can be recycled
    by pressing <img border="0" width="16" height="16" src="2_4/images/image032.gif" /> next
    to the device in question.</p>

  <h2>Licensing rational</h2>
  <p>Auditor
    core is licensed by the total number of up interfaces. The total is calculated
    by adding all the up interfaces on devices polled by Auditor. </p>

        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
           Once an interface is seen up it is counted in the total until the device
    licenses are recycled.</td>

  <p>Capacity
    planning module is a separate license option based on the number of Auditor
    core interface license level.</p>
  <h2>Adding
    a License key</h2>
  <p>When
    accessing the Auditor web interface for the first time, it runs in trial
    mode – this means it will operate for a period of 7 days unless a license
    key is applied to the system. License administration is accessed from the
    Admin dropdown in the top frame, by clicking the arrow:</p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image036.jpg" /></center>
  <p>To
    view license information simply click on the relevant link </p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image038.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Irrespective
    of the modules licensed, Rebasoft issues a single license key that contains
    all the desired elements. To add a license, simply cut and paste the license
    string into the "New License" box and click "load license". </p>
<center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image040.jpg" /></center>
<p>The
    license will validate and confirmation of the system license will be displayed.
    If the license level is exceeded, Auditor will not collect information from
    the additional interfaces until a new key is obtained from an Auditor reseller.</p>
