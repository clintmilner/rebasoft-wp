<h1><span class="purple">MAC forensics</span></h1>
<p>MAC forensics allows users to review the IP and connection history of a MAC address:</p>
 <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image096.jpg"  /></center>
  <p>Auditor
    shows the MAC address, and from the Vendor lookup facility, the Vendor or
    Manufacturer that has the IP Address assigned. </p>
  <p>If
    there is an ARP entry on a device for the MAC address, Auditor will show
    the IP address allocation history of the MAC address. The IP details show
    the history of IP address assignment to the MAC address. </p>
  <p>The
    Connection history shows the connections over time. This is available in
    graphical timeline view or tabular view if details are selected.</p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image098.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Connections
    show the interfaces (and device) that the MAC address has been seen on (The
    MAC Count shows the total number of unique MAC's also on the interface). </p>
