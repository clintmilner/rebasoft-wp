<h1><span class="purple">Searches</span></h1>

  <p>Auditor's powerful search engine allows users to search for items in the
    database. Most users will use the search as way to quickly navigate to the
    point of interest. Searching can be on full or partial matches to the string
    entered in the search box. </p>
  <p>Search accuracy can be improved by specifying a more complete string. For
    example, searching on "10.100.1" will bring up all the matching records with
    the string â€“ in this case matching IP addresses and devices.</p>
  <p>Searches return results in for MAC, User ID, IP address, Hostnames, Device
    details, Interfaces and VLANS: </p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
            You can search for multiple IP addresses by entering a comma between desired IP's</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <br /><br />

  <p>The search results table lists the possible matches. Clicking items on the
    list allows a user to navigate to the relevant forensics report.</p>
        <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
            If you click the search button without entering any parameters, Auditor  returns a search of all entries in the database for the current month.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
 
  <p>Only
    when you select a search result does Auditor query the database (default
    8 days) to see when the item occurred. Information displayed in timelines
    allows users to view longer or short periods of time as required. Using this
    method Auditor, for example, does require users to know when someone was
on the network to see if they've ever logged in.</p>
