<h1><span class="purple">Sites administration</span></h1>
<p>Auditor  provides administrators the
      ability to model their real-world network with Sites. A Site is simply
      a container that can comprise devices and/or other sites (child sites).
      The network can therefore be related to physical or logical locations with,
      for example, locations being divided into sub-locations that contain devices.
      A site can contain both devices and sub-sites.</p>
<p>Consider the example below:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="378" height="274"
src="2_4/images/image250.jpg" /></center>
<p>In this case, the administrator has
      defined USA as a top level (or parent) site and New York and San Francisco
      as sub (or child) sites. New York and San Francisco could themselves contain
      child sites and/or devices.</p>
 <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
          
A site can also be assigned a Visual. A Visual is an image file that is displayed when the site is selected. Visuals are uploaded and assigned when the site is selected.</p></td>

<p>To add a site, simply type a name
      and click the "Add New Site" button.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="153" height="118"
src="2_4/images/image255.jpg" /></center>
<p>Once a site has been added it will appear in the Existing
      sites list. Administrators can add or remove a device by using the cursor
      to select a device and add or remove it from the members list. </p>
<center><img border="0" width="461" height="343"
src="2_4/images/image257.jpg" /></center>
<p>To remove a site, simply highlight
      the site &amp; click the "Remove site button". Removing a site does not
      remove the device or data for that device. The device will remain in any
      other site it is a member of, or will appear in "Unallocated devices" </p>
<p>To rename a site, simply highlight
      the site, type in the new name and click the "Rename Site" button.</p>
<p>If any device is not a member of a parent site, it is accessible via a
        dynamically created site named "Unassigned Devices". This can be a useful
        way of tracking any device that is not a member of any site.</p>
<p>In the same way a device can be a
        member of more than one site, so a site may be a child of one or more
        parent sites.</p>
<p>In the display frame, as sites are
        selected, the configured visual is shown. Child sites or devices can
        be selected and viewed either by clicking through the map or from the
        Site and device selector.</p>

<p>Images can be uploaded via the Visual
        upload button</p>
