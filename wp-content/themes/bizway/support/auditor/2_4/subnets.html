<h1><span class="purple">Subnets</span></h1>
<p>Subnet administration allows
        you define network segments and apply one or more in filters for use
        in Auditor. One reason this may be desirable is when defining integrations,
        where a particular tool or application to be called is only relevant
        to a set of devices in part of the network.</p>
<p>Subnets are defined from the
        subnets administration dialog:</p>

<h2>Subnet administration</h2>
<p>By default,
          a subnet encompassing all IP networks is defined. To create a subnet,
          simply provide a name and description (these are also seen elsewhere
          in Auditor reports, so it is worthwhile using meaning names) and a
          subnet together with the subnet mask.</p>

<p>Subnets
          can be deleted after creation if required.</p>
<h2>Subnet filters</h2>
<p>Once
          you have defined the desired subnets, you can create a filter. This
          is a matter of inputting a name and selection (or multi-selecting with
          "control" clicking the subnets) and then clicking "Add new subnet filter". </p>
