<h1><span class="purple">System settings administration</span></h1>
<p>One of the first actions recommended is the configuration
        of system settings. System level settings are used throughout the application.
        Here administrators can set-up:</p>
        <br />

 <a href="#mac">MAC Vendor table</a> | <a href="#oid">OID Vendor database</a> | <a href="#vendor">Vendor OID</a> | <a href="#log">Log level settings</a></center><br />
<p>System settings are accessed from the Administration
        dropdown in the top frame (clicking the arrow):</p>

<p>A summary of the current system
        settings and directory locations are shown at the bottom of the system
        settings page:</p>

<h2><a id="snmp"></a>SNMP Settings</h2
><p>SNMP settings allow administrators to control Auditor
        SNMP settings. System wide community strings can be set (these can be
        overridden during device discovery) as well as enabling overrides for
        SNMP discovered information. </p>
<p>SNMP Community strings, if entered during device input,
        are used first. In the absence of a specified SNMP community string,
        system level SNMP communities are used in turn until a successful poll
        is performed. Auditor  then stores the successful string with the device,
        this reduces the number of alerts that a device might generate if a community
        is used unsuccessfully.  It is only necessary to use Read-only strings. </p>
<p>To add a new community simply type the string into the
        box &amp; click "Add community"</p>
<center><img border="0" width="305" height="138"
src="2_4/images/image211.jpg" /></center>
<p>To remove a community, simply
        click the cross next to the string to be removed</p>
<p>Auditor also has two new facilities
        requested by our customers, namely to change device name cases. Administrators
        can select UPPER or lower cases for storage and display; in which case
        following each SNMP poll, Auditor stores the device name in the required
        case. "Do nothing" simply accepts the device name (hostname) as configured
        from the polled device.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="280" height="116"
src="2_4/images/image213.jpg" /></center>
<p>Sometimes, for legibility in
        Auditor, it is desirable to remove text from the device name. This may
        be useful if the device (hostname) is a FQDN format (such as cat3750-rm104.abcompany.com),
        you can then remove any desired element (for example ".abcompany.com")
        from the device name. This setting is also persistent even when the device
        is re-polled by SNMP.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="290" height="121"
src="2_4/images/image215.jpg" /></center>
<h2><a id="cdp"></a>Network Discovery</h2>
<p>Auditor (V2.2 or later) provides
        the ability to automatically discover network devices using Cisco Discovery
        Protocol (CDP) and/or Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). These protocols
        rely upon the network devices to be discovered having CDP or LLDP enabled.
        The configuration guides of the various vendors can advise on how CDP/LLDP
        can be enabled. </p>
<center><img border="0" width="259" height="102"
src="2_4/images/image217.jpg" /></center>
<p>CDP and LLDP have two operating
        modes. CDP and LLDP can be used to add devices to Auditors polling list,
        and this collect ARP, CAM and other information from the MIB. In addition
        CDP and LLDP can be used to resolve hostnames, such as the phone ID for
        Cisco IP phones.</p>
<p>Subnet filters can be applied to CDP and LLDP settings to
  limit the bounds of CDP and LLDP discovery, to reduce traffic and prevent devices
  inadvertently being added to Auditor’s device list.</p>
<h2><a id="syslog"></a>Syslog settings for Alert output</h2>
<p>The current release of Auditor  has provision for alerting
        using syslog. Administrators can set multiple syslog servers depending
        on network preferences. To enter a syslog server, simply specify a name,
        required level and facility together with the target address. Administrators
        can also set the syslog level and facility to suit any log processing
        or alert handling system.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="546" height="242"
src="2_4/images/image219.jpg" /></center>
<p>Syslog server receivers can
        be removed by simply clicking the cross next to the syslog to be removed</p>
<h2><a id="sys"></a>System Settings</h2>
<p>This shows the current settings
        as configured during the installation process:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="477" height="157"
src="2_4/images/image221.jpg" /></center>
<h2><a id="db"></a>Database Settings</h2>
<p>Database settings allow administrators
        to refine and set controls for the amount of data stored by Auditor.
        The system comes with a series of defaults, but depending on organization
        policy and the amount of disk available on the Auditor server these settings
        can be overridden.</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
          From Auditor 2.2 onwards, it is possible to install the Auditor database on a separate database server or NAS from the polling engine.</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br />
<p>Auditor shows a list of the
        largest tables on the system, if these are no-longer required they can
        be deleted:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="499" height="358"
src="2_4/images/image224.jpg" /></center>
<h2><a id="mac"></a>MAC Address - Company ID</h2>
<p>IEEE maintains an index of
        MAC address prefixes in relation to Vendors. This index changes from
        time-to-time, and any new release of Auditor  will contain the latest
        index. If, however, you search Auditor  and see a MAC address without
        a vendor entry, it may be that the index is out-of-date. </p>
<p>Since this file is a large
        file, a facility to download and update Auditor  on request if available:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="565" height="110"
src="2_4/images/image226.jpg" /></center>
<h2><a id="oid"></a>OID Vendor database</h2>
<p>The OID Vendor database is
        used for vendors where Auditor needs to create a specific polling scheme,
        this dialog allows the Rebasoft development team to rapidly deliver a
        specific polling type for new types of vendor hardware.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="274" height="161"
src="2_4/images/image228.jpg" /></center>
<h2><a id="vendor"></a>Vendor OID</h2>
<p>If a device type is displaying
        the OID string as numbers in the device overview page, it is possible
        to override this and put a description that may be of more value to users.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="237" height="73"
src="2_4/images/image230.jpg" /></center>
<p>In this case putting "1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.1.1.1.2.36"
        together with a vendor and device description would allow administrators
        to display a consistent name for the device. </p>
<center><img border="0" width="284" height="169"
src="2_4/images/image232.jpg" /></center>
<p>To change a description, simply
        input the OID with a new device and vendor name</p>
<h2><a id="log"></a>Log settings</h2>
<p>Auditor writes system and event
        information to its system log located in %\windows\system32\ - called
        MACAuditor.log. The default level is info. From time to time it may be
        necessary to collect and log more information. This can be set via Log
        settings – the default level is "Info". Once the log settings have been
        changed, the Auditor service needs to be restarted to take effect</p>
