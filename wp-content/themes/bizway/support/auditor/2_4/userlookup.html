                Lookup administration</span></h1>
<p>A powerful feature of Auditor  is the associating of
        user login information. This allows organisations to search on UserID
        as well as IP address and MAC. The association of this information makes
        it easy to find users on the network for help desk and audit purposes.</p>
<center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image262.jpg" /></center>
<p>Auditor  supports user lookup via LDAP systems, such
        as Novell eDirectory, and Windows 2003 &amp; 2008 Active Directory. Since
        Active Directory does not store user login requests in the directory;
        rather Microsoft records user logon/logoff information in the system
        security log, the log must be accessible to the user configured in the
        User lookup settings. </p>
<p>User details are fully searchable once stored in the
        database. Please note that Auditor  polls the directory service configured
        once per hour, and looks for login records. Hence it may be some time
        before UserID information appears in the system.</p>
<p>To access user lookup, select from the Admin menu:</p>

<p>The TAG used in setting up LDAP and Active Directory
        look up is a label used in reporting. If you have multiple LDAP or PDC/BDC
        servers, you could tag them with one or more names. For example you have
        an internal domain of &quot;abccompany.local&quot;, but use multiple
        authentication servers on your network, using
  &quot;abccompany.local&quot; as a tag for each server being polled will allow
  Auditor  to group all user entries for that group of DC's into a single report.</p>
<h2>User lookup with LDAP</h2>
<p>Auditor  supports user lookup via LDAP. To add LDAP
        lookup, administrators should complete the LDAP form below, providing
        credentials and LDAP parameters. </p>
 <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
          Rebasoft recommends the polling period of 3600000 milliseconds be left as default, and that a filter of loginDisabled=FALSE be applied</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br />
<p>Following configuration, an
        entry similar to below should be saved:</p>
<p>java.naming.provider.url:ldap://x.x.x.x:389<br />
  java.naming.factory.initial:com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory<br />
  java.naming.security.principal:cn=company,ou=servers,o=ldap-servers<br />
  java.naming.security.authentication:None<br />
  java.naming.security.credentials:********<br />
  java.naming.ldap.attributes.binary:networkAddress<br />
  Polling Period:3600000<br />
  Filter:loginDisabled=FALSE</p>
<h2>User lookup with Active Directory</h2>
<p>User lookup for Active Directory login information is
        available for both Windows 2003 and 2008 platforms. Windows authentication
        lookup allows you to specify a UTC offset for the logs. This is dues
        to the fact that Windows stores the timestamp in UTC, and an offset may
        need to be manually set in order for the correct time period to be collected
        (this being due to the Auditor clock being local server time).</p>

src="2_4/images/image269.jpg"  /></center>
<p>To add a lookup, simply specify a tag – this identifies
        which server Auditor  has used for the look-up. Specify the server address,
        domain name and user ID &amp; password. If a polling period different
        from 10 minutes is required, this can be overridden. It is not recommended
        to change the UserExcludeFilter period.</p>

<p>To verify that a user lookup
        is working correctly, you can press the test button next to the user
        lookup entry:</p>
