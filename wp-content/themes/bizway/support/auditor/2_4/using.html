<h1><span class="purple">Using Auditor</span></h1>
  <p>Once Auditor is set-up and collecting information, it can be reported upon.
    There are three main methods accessing data and drilling into reports:</p>
<ul>    
<li><a href="#nav">Using the Navigator</a></li>
<li><a href="#search">Searches</a></li>
<li><a href="#event">Events</a></li></ul>
  </p>
<h2><a href="nav"></a>Using the Navigator</h2>
  <p>Auditor allows users to logically drill down from Sites to Devices to VLANs,
    Interfaces or MACs within a few clicks. Navigation is simply an exercise
    in expanding or collapsing sites that you have defined, clicking hyperlinks
    or through the Site visuals. An expanded view of all sites/devices can be
    seen using the collapse/expand all controls at the top of the list:</p>
    
 <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image065.jpg" /></center>
  <p>If a site is selected, a preselected image is displayed in the display frame
    and child sites and/or devices at that level are displayed in the display
    frame. For example, when USA is clicked, a map of the USA, and the sites
    contained within the USA site are displayed. </p>
  <h3>Filtering the list of sites &amp; devices</h3>
  <p>To
    help with getting rapidly to the right device Sites and devices entries can
    be filtered. To access the Sites &amp; Devices filter, click the icon next
    to the heading</p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image067.png" /></center>
  <p>To find the device of interest, simply start keying the start of the ID,
    Auditor will dynamically compress the list</p>

<h2><a href="search"></a>Searches</h2>

  <p>Auditor's powerful search engine allows users to search for items in the
    database. Most users will use the search as way to quickly navigate to the
    point of interest. Searching can be on full or partial matches to the string
    entered in the search box. </p>
  <p>Search accuracy can be improved by specifying a more complete string. For
    example, searching on "10.100.1" will bring up all the matching records with
    the string â€“ in this case matching IP addresses and devices.</p>
  <p>Searches return results in for MAC, User ID, IP address, Hostnames, Device
    details, Interfaces and VLANS: </p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
            You can search for multiple IP addresses by entering a comma between desired IP's</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <br /><br />
    <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image072.jpg" /></center>
  <p>The search results table lists the possible matches. Clicking items on the
    list allows a user to navigate to the relevant forensics report.</p>
        <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td class="box"><i><span class="purple">Note:</span></i><p style="font-size:1em;">
            If you click the search button without entering any parameters, Auditor  returns a search of all entries in the database for the current month.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
 
  <p>Only
    when you select a search result does Auditor query the database (default
    8 days) to see when the item occurred. Information displayed in timelines
    allows users to view longer or short periods of time as required. Using this
    method Auditor, for example, does require users to know when someone was
on the network to see if they've ever logged in.</p>


<h2><a href="event"></a>Events</h2>  
<p>Auditor
    alerts users and logs these events to the web console or, optionally, one
    or more syslog servers.</p>
  <p>Events
    are classified by type (System, User, Watchlist, Whitelist and device).</p>
<center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image075.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Clicking
    any of the hyperlinks will filter the event list to display the relevant
    information.</p>
<center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image077.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Events
    can be deleted, acknowledged or un-acknowledged. These actions do not affect
    any events that have already been forwarded to any external syslog received
    configured in Syslog settings for Alert settings.</p>
