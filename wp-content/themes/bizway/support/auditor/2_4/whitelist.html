<h1><span class="purple">White list</span></h1>
  <p>While list is selectable by site, and is a facility to generate alerts on
    new devices accessing the network at that site. For example if you have a
    locked down standard build for a remote location, you can use Auditor to
    alert on any device not previously seen connecting to the network at that
    site. White list alerts are reported to the Site overview screen, the events
    system and, optionally, a syslog receiver.</p>

  <p>White lists are configured by accessing the admin selector:</p>

  <p>White list settings provide the ability to start, stop and reset White list
    monitoring. If a configured site has one or more devices being polled by
    Auditor , monitoring can be activated by clicking the "Monitor" button.</p>

  <p>If an asset system already records the MAC address of devices, these can
    be manually added to Auditor via the "Add" button.</p>

  <p>Once monitoring has been activated new devices seen are alerted to the event
    subsystem, where the device, interface and MAC address are shown. Users can
    click the MAC address to view MAC forensics</p>

  <p>White lists, once set up can be changed and updated via the White list administration
    dialog: </p>

  <p>Newly discovered MAC addresses can be automatically included in the White
    list by clicking the "Reset" button. Users can also add a list of MAC addresses
    by clicking the "Add" button.</p>
  <p>MAC addresses can be added singly to the White list by selecting them from
    the "new" list</p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image132.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Individual MAC addresses can be added by clicking "Add to White list"</p>
  <p>For roaming users, a Global Whitelist override is provided. Any MAC address
    in the global list will not generate an alert if newly discovered at a monitored
    site:</p>
