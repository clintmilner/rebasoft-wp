<h1><span class="purple">Device administration</span></h1>
<p>Any device that has a CAM table can be a data source
        for Auditor  – this might be Layer 3 switch, Router or Firewall. Auditor  uses
        SNMP to poll device MIB parameters using RFC standards to retrieve the
        required information from the device. Where a device is not compliant,
        it is possible to use a custom MIB – Rebasoft will consider adding vendor
        MIBs to Auditor  to support customer requirements. We have also provided
        an over-ride to cater to devices where the MIB definitions present inconsistent
        results.</p>
<p>To add, delete or manage existing devices, administrators
        should select "Devices" from the administration dropdown &amp; click
        the arrow: </p>

<h2>Add a device</h2>
<p>Devices can be added either directly from their IP address
        or from their assigned DNS name. Administrators can add up to 10 devices
        via the add device button. To add more than 10 devices, it is advisable
        to use the bulk loading dialog. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%">
  <tr valign="middle">
    <td width="6%" style="background:#663399;" ><span style="color:#fff; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;">note:</span></td>
    <td width="94%" style="border: 1px solid #663399;"><i></i>
      <p style="font-size:1em;">To add a device (or devices) directly to a site, simply select from the site dropdown. If the site selector is &quot;none&quot;, the device will be added to the &quot;All devices&quot; site only.</p></td>

<p>To add multiple devices, simply separate with a comma;
        for example "router1, switch1, firewall8" will add 3 devices – DNS will
        resolve the device to the current IP address. Up to 10 devices may be
        added using this method using IP addresses. </p>
<p>To add a range of devices, simply add the start of the
        range and the end of the range separated with a space; for example "1.1.1.1
        1.1.1.50" will add and scan fifty devices from 1.1.1.1 to 1.1.1.50. </p>
<p>For multiple ranges, it is recommended that the bulk
        load facility is used</p>
<center><img border="0" width="624" height="213"
src="2_4/images/image241.jpg" /></center>
<p>Devices can be bulk loaded by cutting and pasting lines
        into the Bulk load dialog. The format of the load is shown below:</p>
<code>&nbsp; &lt;ipaddress&gt;:&lt;snmpCommunity&gt;:&lt;SiteName&gt;</code>
<p>This
        loads a single IP address per line. If snmpCommunity is omitted, Auditor  uses
        the system defaults in turn to contact the device. If SiteName is omitted,
        device is added to "All devices". The colon ( : ) is a field delimiter.
        If the site does not currently exist, it will be created dynamically</p>
<code>&nbsp; &lt;ipaddress_start&gt; &lt;ipaddress_end&gt;:snmpCommunity:SiteName</code>
<p>In
        this case the space between the 2 IP addresses indicates that Auditor  should
        add the range of addresses between the two. The same provisions apply
        for snmpCommunity &amp; SiteName</p>
<code>&nbsp; &lt;ipaddress_1&gt;,&lt;ipaddress_2&gt;,&lt;ipaddress_3&gt;:&lt;snmpCommunity&gt;:&lt;SiteName&gt;</code>
<p>A
        set of IP addresses separated by commas constitutes a list to be processed.</p>
<p>If more than 90 devices are
        loaded at a time, then the list of devices can be up loaded in a file,
        the same format rules apply as in single device<br />
  <br />
  </p>
<h2>Changing device settings</h2>
<p>Once a device has been added to the Auditor  database,
        certain settings can be overridden or adjusted.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="515" height="101"
src="2_4/images/image243.jpg" /></center>
<p>The list of devices in the Auditor database is shown,
        a filter is provided to narrow down the list if a large number of devices
        are present.</p>
<p>To select a device to view or edit, simply highlight
        it from the list. A summary of the device is show, and options, as below,
        are available for view or override.</p>

  <p>With V2.5, Rebasoft supports SNMP V3, selecting the SNMP Version "3" from the dropdown, allows administrators to enter SNMP V3 authentication and encryption settings:</p>
  <center><img border="0" width="403" 
src="2_4/images/device-snmpv3.png" /></center>

<p>It is possible to enable or disable a device, simply
        tick the enable box, and then click the "<b>Save
        device"</b> button. Failure to click the save device button will
        cause changes to be lost if navigating away from the page:</p>
<p><b>"Rescan"</b> will cause the device
  to be polled using SNMP.</p>
<p><b>"Save device"</b> will cause the
  device updated information to be to be saved to the database. Navigation away
  from this page without saving changes causes them to be lost.</p>
<p><b>"Remove device"</b> deletes the
  device from Auditor , but does not delete the device data collected in the
  current month. Removing a device will stop it being polled for information.
  A removed device / interface will not count towards the license count, but
  will still appear in the sites/devices list.</p>
<p><b>"Remove device and data"</b> removes
  all device and information collected via that device from the Auditor  system
  for the current month. Any data collected via a different device will still
  remain in the database. Hence MAC, IP and UserID data will still remain in
  the system if it has been collected via another device.</p>
<p><b>"Test device"</b> sends an SNMP
  get command immediately to the device – this helps when troubleshooting SNMP
  issues while adding devices – where for example a firewall port might need
  to be opened (port 161) to enable successful SNMP polling</p>
<p><b>"Reset interfaces"</b> reverts
  any manual changes back to those collected via SNMP from the target device</p>
<p><b>"Test bridge table"</b> returns
  the output from the CAM/Bridge table on the target device – thus providing
  a direct cross check that Auditor is returning information from the target
  device.</p>
<p>It is also possible to override standard interface names
        and add descriptions to aid users:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="531" height="127"
src="2_4/images/image247.jpg" /></center>
<p>If the interface index, or
        retrieved parameter does not match the desired display, administrators
        can override the "ifindex", name and description displayed. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%">
  <tr valign="middle">
    <td width="6%" style="background:#663399;" ><span style="color:#fff; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;">note:</span></td>
    <td width="94%" style="border: 1px solid #663399;"><i></i>
      <p style="font-size:1em;">The labels in the reports will be marked with * to differentiate the interface from polled information.</p></td>

<p>Use of this facility should
        be carefully considered as reports against interfaces may not be accurately
shown.</p>
