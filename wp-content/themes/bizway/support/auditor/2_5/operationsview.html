<h1><span class="purple">Operations  View</span></h1>
  <p>The operations view is the Core of Auditor. It provides the capability to
    report and support for operational requirements. Access to data and reports
    is via the Navigator or searches. Browsing reports is hierarchal starting
    at a Site and drilling down to child sites or devices.</p>
  <p>At the top of the site overview report, there are quick-links to reports
    on IP addresses, end-devices and interfaces.</p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image079.jpg" /></center>
  <p>If there are any Whitelist alerts, these are also shown as quick-links</p>
  <p>The default is to hide visuals and display a simple dashboard of connected
    devices, however in the visual it is also possible for users to position
    sites and devices on the visuals and save them for the next user using the "save" icon
    next to the Site visual.</p>
<center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image081.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Within the Site overview, a series of time based summary reports for the
    site are display:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>MAC Addresses seen</li>
   <li>Top 5 Devices over time</li>
   <li>IP Addresses seen</li>
   <li>Devices seen in use</li>
   <li>Interfaces seen in use</li>
   <li>Interfaces by MAC count</li>
   <li>Interfaces by IP count</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is also possible to report on "Down interface", (this can be used as
    the basis of a free ports report), MAC's by Vendor, MAC's by IP count, MAC's
    by Interface count and IP's by MAC count. </p>
  <p>Auditor will, during initial device discovery, poll the interface clock
    for last used status and use this as a start point for last used information.
    Where interface last used status is unavailable, Auditor will use the polling
    information. Subsequent polling for interface status will update Auditor
    down interface reports.</p>
  <p>From the Sites and devices menu, selecting a device will show a device overview,
    key reports, interface statistics and lists of the interfaces and VLANs on
    the device:</p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image083.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Clicking a device provides an overview with a summary of key information
    and quick links to reports. Auditor shows the hostname, IP address/DNS name,
    type and the SNMP retrieved description. The device up-time is also displayed.
    All information in the device details area is searchable within the database.
    For each device, below the device details, users can view reports for the
    device.</p>
  <p>Please note the "Tools" line – this is where Integration for
    devices appears. We have shown a few examples. </p>
  <p>To the right of the device details are the stored tags for the device. These
    tags can be updated or deleted as required.</p>
  <p>Auditor also shows the up and down
    interfaces on a device, this information can feed into capacity plans – the
    image below shows areas of interest:</p>
 <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image085.jpg" /></center>
 
<ol>
<li>To filter on an interface, simply click the interface name for the Interface
      overview – this will report on MAC address seen over time on that interface,
      IP's seen, and MAC Address vendors.</li>
<li>To directly list the MAC addresses on the interface click on the number under
    the MAC's column</li>
<li>If you move the cursor over the Last Changed column, Auditor will
    display the MAC, IP/Netmask (if any) configured for the interface</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Recent
    shows the last 30 minutes of the interface status – in the image above, you
    can see FastEthernet0/3 has been "going up and down", possibly indicating
    an issue.</p>
