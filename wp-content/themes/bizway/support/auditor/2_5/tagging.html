<h1><span class="purple">Tagging</span></h1>
<p>To a non-technical user, a network
        can be a difficult thing to decipher and understand. Auditor can help
        with this via the ability to "Tag" an item with additional information.
        This information may be something as simple as the ability for a note
        to be manually entered – for example a MAC Address with "Mike’s desktop
        pc" - through to the same MAC address being associated with data imported
        or updated from an asset management system. With the right information,
        It is possible to answer a question like "how many dell pc’s running
        Windows XP service pack 3 do I have on my network?"</p>
<p>Administrators can set any number
        of "extra dimensions" available for tagging. There are two methods of
        tagging within Auditor :</p>
<ol><li><a href="#manual">Manually</a> – set via the Tagging administration dialog</li>
<li><a href="#csv">CSV import</a> from, for example,  excel spread sheet, also set via Tagging administration</li></ol>
<p>As soon as a tag has been stored
        in Auditor  it is searchable and available for reporting. In the same
        way tags can also be deleted (permanently) from the database. As tagged
        information is available from external sources, Auditor  also has a way
        to make that information permanent or transient depending on how the
        data is imported.</p>
<p>Tagging is accessed via the
        Admin dropdown:</p>

<h2><a id="manual"></a>Manual tag building and data entry</h2>
<p>Manual tagging allows administrators
        to add a category to data types within Auditor . The tagging administration
        screen allows administrators to add tag categories that can be used within
        the application. </p>
<p>From V2.4, Auditor allows administrators
        to define a tag and:</p>
<ol>
<li>State
  whether the values in the tag are unique (so within an element you could have
  a department with either a single allowable entry, or multiple entries)</li>
<p>Set
  an expiry lifetime for the tag</p>
<li>Set
  a url and pass the tag contents as part of the url. In the example below, Auditor
  is passing the phone extension number to a VoIP monitoring module.</li></ol>

<p>So for instance, you might want
        to record the "Operating system for a MAC Address (Say "Windows 7").  To
        build this, you simply key the desired name into the field next to the
        tag type and hit the green "plus" button.</p>
<center><img border="0" width="244" height="139"
src="2_4/images/image172.jpg" /></center>
<p>The moment the tag category
        is added, it is available for use by users:</p>
<p>To add information via Auditor,
        simply click the "plus" button – in this case to add OS details to this
        Dell MAC Address:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="627" height="130"
src="2_4/images/image174.png" /></center>
<p>If there is more than one category,
        simply select from the drop-down, key in the information and click "add"</p>
<center><img border="0" width="282" height="122"
src="2_4/images/image176.png" /></center>
<p>Once the information is added,
        it is available for search. Information can be deleted by "moussing"
        over the tag, and clicking the small red cross to delete:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="216" height="73"
src="2_4/images/image178.png" /></center>
<h2><a id="csv"></a>CSV import </h2>
<p>Clearly manual tagging has somewhat
        limited scope, especially when there are thousands of devices, users
        and IP’s connected to the network.</p>
<p>In the case where larger quantities
        of data need to be added, an import method is needed. If data is available
        in "csv" format, the information can be imported into Auditor tags:</p>
<center><img border="0" width="303" height="131"
src="2_4/images/image180.png" /></center>
<p>Simply browse to the spread
        sheet (in csv format) and upload to Auditor. Once successfully uploaded,
        administrators can click on the filename and complete the import process.</p>
<p>The workflow confirms:</p>
<ol>
<li>the file-type; CSV (Commas Separated Values) or TSV (Tab Separated Values), </li>
<li>whether
  you wish to include the header line as a value or not.</li>
<li>(After
  pressing the Test button, the data is displayed)</li>
<li>Simply
  select the Tag type – where you want the data displayed</li>
<li>Enter
  the category name, and which columns represent the item reference column and
  the Value column – this case, what is the MAC address we wish to associate
  the data with, and the data column we wish to insert.</li>
  </ol>

<p>A future version of Auditor  will
        include the ability to use XML to reference external applications (such
        as HR or an Asset management system) as the source to replicate the data
        from.</p>
