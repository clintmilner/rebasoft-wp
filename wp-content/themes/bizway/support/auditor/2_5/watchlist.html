<h1><span class="purple">Watch list</span></h1>
  <p>Auditor is able to help track devices on the network. Whether users require
    alerts about a rogue access point, or a stolen Laptop, as soon as it is seen
    on the network, a Watch list alert is displayed and a syslog alert is optionally
    generated. Clicking on the hyperlink shows a list of watched devices and
    when seen on the network: </p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image108.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Users
    can click manage the alert or click on the MAC address link to see further
    details on the device. </p>
  <p>Watch
    lists can be added via 2 methods. From the MAC forensics screen by clicking
    the "Add Watch entry" link: </p>
<center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image110.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Or via the Watch list admin drop down:</p>
    <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image112.jpg" /></center>
    <p><br />
      <br />
    </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%">
      <tr valign="middle">
        <td style="background:#663399;" ><span style="color:#fff; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;">note:</span></td>
        <td style="border: 1px solid #663399;"><span class="box">Only administrators can add a watch entry</span></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>Watch lists are configured in the following screen:</p>
  <center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image115.jpg" /></center>
  <p>Add device (plus a description) to the watch list.</p>
  <p>Once
    the watch list device is added, decide on an alerting setting if required.</p>
  <p>Alerts
    for watch lists can be multiple and can be deleted without the Watch list
    entry being deleted.</p>
  <p>Alerts are only sent when a MAC address is first seen by the Auditor </p>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%">
    <tr valign="middle">
      <td style="background:#663399;" ><span style="color:#fff; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;">note:</span></td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #663399;"><span class="box">Restarting Auditor  does not cause generation of new alerts as the system retains Watchlist status information in the database.</span></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>If a previously seen MAC address leaves the network (for the CAM hold down
    period) and Auditor is then restarted you will, of course, generate an alert
    as this would be classed as a new Watchlist hit.</p>
<p>The syslog message will be sent as:</p>
  <p>messages.2:Sep&nbsp; 1 17:32:42 172.21.40.199 Auditor <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>Â Watch
    Entry Seen:00:1f:c5:ed:ae:23 on Device:172.21.40.254 ifIndex:3 Reason:Wii</p>
<center><img border="0" src="2_4/images/image118.jpg" /></center>
  <p>The MAC Forensics screen now also alerts users as to whether the particular
    device is being watched.</p>
