<h1><span class="purple">IP Forensics</span></h1>
  <p>From any screen it is possible to drill into IP forensics, where details on DNS,
    UserID, ARP and interfaces are shown for the IP address.</p>

  <p>New
    in V2.1 is the ability not only to display DNS, but to cache and search on
    it in the database. IP information can be located now via MAC, User and DNS.</p>
  <p>Where
    possible, Auditor will show last seen MAC to IP association. If the ARP information
    for the Last Seen MAC is not collected by the system, Auditor cannot display
    this information.</p>
  <p>Below
    the Last Seen entry, Auditor will show if there is any user association with
    the IP address, and show, over time, which users have been associated with
    the IP address. The User or green bar can be clicked to navigate to User
    forensics.</p>
  <p>IP
    forensics shows the ARP information for IP relation to MAC address, and where
    that MAC address has been seen over time.</p>

<p>On IP forensics and IP address lists Active Tests,
    if configured for the IP range selected, are executed, and the results displayed.
    See Active Tests for
    a detailed description on how this operates.</p>
