<h1><span class="purple">Using the Navigator</span></h1>
  <p>Auditor allows users to logically drill down from Sites to Devices to VLANs,
    Interfaces or MACs within a few clicks. Navigation is simply an exercise
    in expanding or collapsing sites that you have defined, clicking hyperlinks
    or through the Site visuals. An expanded view of all sites/devices can be
    seen using the collapse/expand all controls at the top of the list:</p>

  <p>If a site is selected, a preselected image is displayed in the display frame
    and child sites and/or devices at that level are displayed in the display
    frame. For example, when USA is clicked, a map of the USA, and the sites
    contained within the USA site are displayed. </p>
