<h1><span class="purple">Auditor for Risk Management</span></h1>
<p>Auditor provides a security solution
  for organisations by supporting IT risk management. Auditor V2.6 does this in
  three main ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring that organisations are aware of the extent of the
  infrastructure. This is the foundation of any risk management exercise, as it
  defines the risk domain. If the domain does not contain the whole
  infrastructure, then any risk management exercise may have security gaps<br /><br />

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</center></li>
<li>Classification and approval of all connected devices. Starting with
  discovered MAC addresses, Auditor allows security administrators to classify
  and approve devices. This enables organisations to ensure all devices can have
  appropriate security controls applied

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</center></li>
<li>Alerting. Auditor
  provides three main security alert capabilities that enable organisations to
  respond to potential threats in real time.
  <ul>
<li>Locate and
  tracking potential rogue devices </li>
<li>Locate and alert
  on new / unknown devices </li>
<li>Locate and
  alert new infrastructure uplinks - enabling organisations to spot potential
  rogue access points/ hubs as they try to bypass network security controls
  </li></ul>

 <a name="#edge"></a><h2>Network Edge</h2>
  <p>Understanding the boundary or edges of the infrastructure is
    a key part in defining the risk domain and, thus, being sure that all devices
    connected to the infrastructure can be seen. Network edges exist in many forms,
    but all essentially provide access to or from different parts of the network. Network
  edges can be either wired or wireless. </p>
  <p>Rebasoft helps with Risk Management by locating and
    classifying network edges. A simple workflow allows administrators to identify
    and approve all edges. By classifying and approving all edges, administrators
    can ensure that all major ingress and egress points are under control, and that
    no unauthorised network infrastructure device or uplink can be used for network
  access.</p>
  <p>Network Edge Interface reports, therefore, starts by focussing
    on differentiating network device interconnections (edges) from network interfaces
  used for end-device connections (access ports).</p>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%">
      <tr valign="middle">
        <td width="6%" valign="top" style="background:#663399;" ><span style="color:#fff; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;">Note:</span></td>
        <td width="94%" style="border: 1px solid #663399;">
          Administrators define an edge through the &quot;Uplink Threshold MAC Count&quot;
        setting in System Settings. The default setting is 3, thus any interface with
        more than 3 MAC addresses connected is classified as an uplink or network
        edge</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once a list of edge interfaces has been identified the
    system classifies them by type. Rebasoft, by default, uses the IANA interface
    definitions (see <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaiftype-mib">http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaiftype-mib</a> for more details) These definitions can be amended in system settings to suit
    an organisations reporting requirements. Security administrators can then
    correlate this list and approve. Each uplink can be investigated to see the
    connected devices. Auditor shows the connected devices in the navigator to help
    see where the most devices are connected and thus provide a cue as to where the
  largest risk edges are.</p>
  <center><img border=0
width=236 height=65
src="2_6/images/security_image024.jpg"></center>
  <p>Network Edge is a real-time process that is constantly
  updated:</p>
  <ol><li>Auditor
  profiles all edge interfaces based on the MAC threshold settings</li>
  <li>Alerts are
    generated each time a new network uplink is discovered - this alert may be
  optionally syslogged to a SIEM or other centralised alert/log management system</li>
  <li>Alerts are
    also generated each time a network uplink is classified or approved for audit
  purposes</li></ol>
  <p>In order to process Edge interfaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the desired status &amp; type:</p>
<center><img border=0
width=245 height=266 id="Picture 15"
src="2_6/images/security_image025.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case we have selected "Pending Approval" and the
  Ethernet edge type.</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=624 height=253 id="Picture 16"
src="2_6/images/security_image026.jpg"></p>
<p>To select for approval, simple select individual uplinks, or
  multi select using the check box in the title:</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=177 height=93 id="Picture 21"
src="2_6/images/security_image027.jpg"></p>
<p>The process is then simply a matter of selecting the desired
  edge state and type and click update:</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=328 height=78 id="Picture 23"
src="2_6/images/security_image028.jpg"></p>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%">
      <tr valign="middle">
        <td width="6%" valign="top" style="background:#663399;" ><span style="color:#fff; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;">Note:</span></td>
        <td width="94%" style="border: 1px solid #663399;">
          If State or Type is not selected, the existing settings are retained</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<a name="device"></a> <h2>End device coverage</h2>
<p>Once the extent of the risk domain has been defined, Auditor
  will be seeing all the connected devices. At the lowest level, a device must
  have a MAC address in order to communicate. Auditor tracks MAC addresses in
  real-time. </p>
<p>By default MAC addresses are separated into Infrastructure
  and non-infrastructure categories. Auditor knows which MAC addresses are part
  of the devices being managed by it, thus these are automatically classified as
  type Infrastructure.</p>
<p>Auditor also categorises devices by Vendor (MAC Vendor) in
  the absence of any other data. MAC Addresses seen on the network will also show
  IP address, user or host name if available:</p>
<p><img border=0 width=624 height=50 id="Picture 31"
src="2_6/images/security_image029.jpg"></p>
<p>Auditor also reports on the last seen network device that
  the MAC address was connected to</p>
   <table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="center" width="90%">
      <tr valign="middle">
        <td width="6%" valign="top" style="background:#663399;" ><span style="color:#fff; text-transform:uppercase; font-weight:bold;">Note:</span></td>
        <td width="94%" style="border: 1px solid #663399;">
          If the Security license is applied to an existing system, and the MAC
        address in question has not been present on the system for some time, the
        default of "Server" for the Last seen connection, and interface "0" is set:</p>
      <p align=center style='
  text-align:center;line-height:normal'><img border=0 width=178 height=45
  id="Picture 24"
  src="2_6/images/security_image030.jpg"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can drill into the MAC address to see the forensics,
  which includes further detail on the device:</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=579 height=602 id="Picture 33"
src="2_6/images/security_image031.jpg"></p>
<p>MAC addresses can be manually classified and approved either through the MAC forensics screen - this is useful if investigating a specific
  device - or via the MAC coverage list:</p>
<p><img border=0 width=624 height=229 id="Picture 35"
src="2_6/images/security_image032.jpg"></p>
<p>In the same way as edge reports, MAC addresses can be
  re-classified and approved via the selector:</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=253 height=69 id="Picture 38"
src="2_6/images/security_image033.jpg"></p>
<p>While the manual process of classifying and approving
  devices is possible, Rebasoft recommends using the XML API to load additional
  information about end-devices that cannot be learned directly from the
  infrastructure. Using this feature, passive collection of data about device, OS
  and other useful information can be added to the reporting, making
  classification and approval much easier. For example PC's and servers may have
  an antivirus system such as McAfee. In this case it is possible to regularly
  load ePO data in order to better understand devices:</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=229 height=363 id="Picture 4"
src="2_6/images/security_image034.jpg"></p>
<p>ePO information is tagged to each MAC for example:</p>
<p><img border=0 width=624 height=319 id="Picture 5"
