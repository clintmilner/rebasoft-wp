<h1><span class="purple">User administration</span></h1>
<p>Auditor  offers two levels of security – normal user
        or admin user. Admin users have the ability to create and manage sites,
        users, devices and communities. Normal users are just able to view reports
        and information captured by Auditor . This way, administrators could
        grant access to helpdesk staff without granting privileges to change
        the Auditor  system settings.</p>
<p>Users administration is accessed from the Administration
        dropdown in the top frame; clicking the arrow:</p>

<p>Administrators are then presented with Users administration
        in the information frame:</p>
<p>To add a user, simply type a name and password and select
        whether this user is an admin user via the Admin tick box and then click
        "Add user".</p>
<center><img border="0" width="215" height="294"
src="2_4/images/image196.jpg" /></center>
<p>To reset password or delete
        a user, click on the username from the list (administrators can also
        promote or demote a user from admin privileges at this stage).</p>
